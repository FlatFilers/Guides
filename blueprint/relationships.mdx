description: Referencing data in other Sheets

<Warning>
This is not comparable to a foreign key. There should be no specification of which column to reference as it is multi-variate. A user may establish a relationship in mapping with a soft reference like a company name. Once stored in our system, we will reference by our internal IDs, and on egress we provide the known system_id if available.
</Warning>


Defines a reference to another Sheet. Links should be established automatically by the matching engine or similar upon an evaluation of unique or similar columns between datasets.

## Configuration Options
- **ref** - Full path reference to another Sheet/table configuration. Must be in the same workbook
- **relationship** - The type of relationship this defines. Can be one of has-many or has-one


## Example in context
This example defines two fields with a relationship which references the respective email addresses of the father / mother which is found in another Sheet

```json
// in the context of create Workbook API call
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "key": "father",
      "type": "reference",
      "config": {
        "ref": "parents",
        "key": "email",
        "relationship": "has-one"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "mother",
      "type": "reference",
      "config": {
        "ref": "parents",
        "key": "email",
        "relationship": "has-one"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
