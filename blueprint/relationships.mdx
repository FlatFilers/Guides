description: Referencing data in other Sheets

<Warning>
  This is not comparable to a foreign key. There should be no specification of
  which column to reference as it is multi-variate. A user may establish a
  relationship in mapping with a soft reference like a company name. Once stored
  in our system, we will reference by our internal IDs, and on egress we provide
  the known system_id if available.
</Warning>

The relationship defines a reference to another Sheet. Links should be established automatically by the mapping engine (the logic that creates a mapping plan automatically when a user maps their data into a workbook) or similar upon an evaluation of unique or similar columns between datasets.

## Configuration Options

- **ref** - Full path reference to another Sheet/table configuration. Must be in the same Workbook
- **key** - Key on the other sheet defined above that this field should reference.
- **relationship** - The type of relationship this defines. Currently, only `has-one` is supported

## Usage

### Inheritance

This example introduces two fields linked by a relationship, inheriting the respective email addresses of the father and mother from another Sheet.

```json workbooks.create
// in the context of create Workbook API call
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "key": "father",
      "type": "reference",
      "config": {
        "ref": "parents",
        "key": "email",
        "relationship": "has-one"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "mother",
      "type": "reference",
      "config": {
        "ref": "parents",
        "key": "email",
        "relationship": "has-one"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Lookups

This example mimics a vlookup operation by fetching a value from a linked record and applying it to a designated field in the original record.

The linked record is designated by a reference field in the original record, and the sought-after value is defined by a lookup field in the linked record.

When a lookup value is located, it's placed into the original record's target field. Furthermore, a message is added to the record, detailing the origin of the retrieved value.

<ParamField path="record" type="Object">
  The record to perform the vlookup on.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="referenceFieldKey" type="string">
  The name of the reference field on the original record that links to the
  linked record.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="lookupFieldKey" type="string">
  The name of the field on the linked record that contains the value to be
  looked up.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="targetFieldKey" type="string">
  The name of the field on the original record that the lookup value should be
  set to.
</ParamField>

```jsx
// in the context of listener.use(recordHook){}

export const vlookup = (
  record,
  referenceFieldKey,
  lookupFieldKey,
  targetFieldKey
) => {
  console.log("Initial Record: " + JSON.stringify(record));
  const links = record.getLinks(referenceFieldKey);
  console.log("Linked Record: " + JSON.stringify(links));
  const lookupValue = links?.[0]?.[lookupFieldKey];
  console.log(
    "Reference Fields Key: " +
      referenceFieldKey +
      " : " +
      "LookUpValue: " +
      lookupValue
  );

  if (isNotNil(lookupValue)) {
    record.set(targetFieldKey, lookupValue);
    record.addInfo(
      targetFieldKey,
      `${targetFieldKey} set based on ${referenceFieldKey}.`
    );
  }
};
```
