Constraints allow you to indicate additional validations that will be applied to fields of a Sheet. These constraints are in addition to the implicit constraints based on types of data. (eg: String, Number) For example, a value is required for every record (RequiredConstraint), or every record must contain a unique value for the field (UniqueConstraint).

## RequiredConstraint

Required Constraints indicate that the given field **must** be provided with a non-null value. A `null` value in this case constitutes an empty cell.

## UniqueConstraint 

Unique Constraints indicate that the given field value must only appear **once** in all the values for that field. Note: `null` values will appear many times because they are not considered unique as there is no value to compare.


```json
// within the context of a create Workbook API call 
 "fields": [
  {
    "key": "firstName",
    "type": "string",
    "label": "First Name",
    "constraints": [{"type": "required"}]
  },
  {
    "key": "internalCustomerId",
    "type": "number",
    "label": "Internal Customer Id",
    "constraints": [
      {
        "type": "unique"
      },
      {
        "type": "required"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## ComputedValue

You might notice a ComputedValue type within the Blueprint code. Please do not use this value at this time as it is unsupported and may be deprecated without notice.
