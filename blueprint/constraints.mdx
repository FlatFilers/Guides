Constraints allow you to indicate additional validations that will be applied to fields of a sheet before it can be . These constraints are in addition to the implicit constraints based on types of data. (eg: String, Number) For example, a value is required for every record (RequiredConstraint), or every record must contain a unique value for the field (UniqueConstraint).

## RequiredConstraint

Required Constraints indicate that the given field must be provided with a non-empty value.

## UniqueConstraint 

Unique Constraints indicates that the given field value must only appear once in all the values for that field. One caveat is that "null" (empty value) may appear many times. Instead use RequiredConstraint if you want to disallow nulls entirely.


```json
// within the context of a create Workbook API call 
 "fields": [
    {
      "key": "firstName",
      "type": "string",
      "label": "First Name",
      "constraints": [{"type": "required"}]
    },
    {
      "key": "internalCustomerId",
      "type": "number",
      "label": "Internal Customer Id",
      "constraints": [
        {
          "type": "unique"
        },
        {
          "type": "required"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

## ComputedValue

Observant readers will see there is a ComputedValue type within the blueprint code. Please do not use this value at this time, it's unsupported and may be deprecated without notice.
