# Field level access via `readonly`

On a field level you can restrict a user's interaction with the data to `readonly`. This feature is useful if you're inviting others to view uploaded data, but do not want to allow them to edit that field. See the example in context below:

```json
"fields": [
  {
    "key": "salary",
    "type": "number",
    "config": {
        "decimal_places": 2
    },
    "readonly": true
  }
]
```
