# Sheet level access

<ParamField path="access" type="array" default="*" optional>

</ParamField>

## `"*"` _(default)_
A user can use all access actions to this Sheet

<Warning>
Warning: If you use `"*"` access control, users will gain new functionalities as we expand access controls. Use an exhaustive list today to block future functionality from being added automatically.
</Warning>

  
## `"add"`
A user can add a record(s) to the Sheet

## `"delete"`
A user can delete record(s) from the Sheet

## `"edit"`
A user can edit records (field values) in the Sheet
  
## `"import"`
A user can import CSVs to this Sheet


```json
{
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contacts",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "access": [
        "add",
        "edit"
      ],
      // Define fields
    }
  ]
}
```



# Field-level access via `readonly`

On a field level you can restrict a user's interaction with the data to `readonly`. This feature is useful if you're inviting others to view uploaded data, but do not want to allow them to edit that field. See the example in context below:

```json
"fields": [
  {
    "key": "salary",
    "type": "number",
    "config": {
        "decimal_places": 2
    },
    "readonly": true
  }
]
```
