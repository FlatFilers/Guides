# Sheet level access
With `access` you can control sheet level access allowing users to 

- **`"add"`** - A user can add a record(s) to the sheet
- **`"delete"`** - A user can delete record(s) from the sheet
- **`"edit"`** - A user can edit records (field values) in the sheet
- **`"import"`** - A user can import CSVs to this sheet
- **`"*"`** - `<default>` A user can use all access actions

```json
{
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contacts",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "access": [
        "add",
        "edit"
      ],
      // Define fields
    }
  ]
}
```

<Warning>
Warning: If you use `"*"` access control, users will gain new functionalities as we expand access controls. Use an exhaustive list today to block future functionality from being added automatically.
</Warning>


# Field level access

On a field level you can restrict a user's interaction with the data to `readonly`. This feature is useful if you're inviting others to view uploaded data, but do not want to allow them to edit that field. See the example in context below:

```json
"fields": [
  {
    "key": "salary",
    "type": "number",
    "config": {
        "decimal_places": 2
    },
    "readonly": true
  }
]
