## Choose your path

One of the best parts about Flatfile Platform is its flexibility. You have the ability to pick and choose from all the different pieces of the Platform to create your ideal workflow. This sort of flexibility is what sets us apart, but we realize that giving you a gigantic box of legos and telling you to build something useful might not be the best way to get started. So below, we've got some instruction manuals to get started. You might need to build something simple like a big rectanlge or you may need the Millennium Falcon. Either way, these paths forward are meant to give you a guide to building something that will hopefully look something like what you need.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Simple" icon="hourglass-start" defaultOpen={true}>
        Let's build a simple, client-side importer together that gets you up and running with just a few simple lines of code.

        ```java HelloWorld.java
        // Like the idea of having a quick example snippet here if we
        // can get to a very simple implementation snippet and
        // then going to the full implementation in the link below
        ```
        Go to the [fulle guide](/)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Advanced" icon="hourglass-half">
        Our [advanced guide](/) adds in new functionality, introduces you to some new concepts, and moves the implementation to the server.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="REST API" icon="hourglass-end">
        Need something more advance, but not in Node? Our REST API offers everything you can do elsewhere with endpoints. You just might need some help with the steps to take to get everything configured.
