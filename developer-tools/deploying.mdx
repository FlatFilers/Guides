## Configuring your developer environment
#### `.flatfilerc`

A `.flatfilerc` file should be included in the root of your project if you are workiing server-side.

`endpoint`, `env`, `version`, & `secret` are for the normal configuration of the deployment, whereas everything inside 
`internal` gets passed to the Virtual Machine that runs the <Tooltip>[agent](../concepts/agents)</Tooltip> code. 

Once configured, this file shouldn't need to change until you're deploying to your production environment.

<Warning>This file should be ignored from source control as it includes your secret key.</Warning>

``` json .flatfilerc
{
    "endpoint": "https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1",
    "env": "us_env_12345",
    "version": "10",
    "secret": "ps_12345-1234-1234",
    "internal": {
        "secret": "ps_12345-1234-1234",
    }
}
```

## Deploying a workbook from terminal

#### `npm run deploy`
Once you have configured your workbook, you can deploy your workbook to your account and the environment specified in `.flatfilerc` at any time
by opening the terminal in the root directory and entering `npm run deploy`. 

The CLI will give you prompts and updates as it's deploying:

``` bash
npm run deploy
> flatfile pubsub src/listener.ts

 INFO  Building Workbook
 INFO  Sending Build.js
✔ Access token created
✔ Found Environment: us_env_123456
✔ Agent Created us_ag_12345
```

<Tip>
You'll notice some of the feedback in the terminal mentions you're deploying an <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Agents">[Agent](../concepts/agents)</Tooltip>. 
An Agent is what's working under the hood to automatically get subscriptions to all Events in your environment. 
</Tip>

### See it in your Dashboard

Once your workbook has been deployed, you’ll be able to see a new Space in your [Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com).   Your workbook will be added to every Space you create. 

<Note>
  You can also configure your code to build different workbooks as a Space is created depending on various factors but this is a more advanced configuration. 
  More on how to do this soon. 
</Note>


## Deploying more than once

In most getting started examples, we are focusing on the Workbook; however, you can deploy any change to your code at any time. 

For example, if you are just needing to add a Sheet to an already existing workbook, simply deploy again with the added sheet and everything will update.
