## Deploying a workbook from terminal

#### `npx flatile deploy --token PASTE_SECRET_KEY_HERE`
Once you have configured your workbook, you can deploy your workbook to your account at any time
by opening the terminal in the root directory and entering the command above. 

The CLI will give you prompts and updates as it's deploying:

``` terminal
> npx flatfile@3.3.1 deploy --token sk_123456

✔  Code package compiled to .flatfile/build.js
✔  Code package passed validation
✔  Environment "Default" selected
✔  Event listener deployed and running on your environment "Default". us_ag_1234
```

<Tip>
You'll notice some of the feedback in the terminal mentions you're deploying an <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Agents">[Agent](../concepts/agents)</Tooltip>. 
An Agent is what's working under the hood to automatically get subscriptions to all Events in your environment.

### See it in your Dashboard

Once your workbook has been deployed, you’ll be able to see a new Space in your [Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com).   Your workbook will be added to every Space you create. 

<Note>
  You can also configure your code to build different workbooks as a Space is created depending on various factors but this is a more advanced configuration. 
  More on how to do this soon.

## Deploying more than once

In most getting started examples, we are focusing on the Workbook; however, you can deploy any change to your code at any time. 

For example, if you are just needing to add a Sheet to an already existing workbook, simply deploy again with the added sheet and everything will update.
