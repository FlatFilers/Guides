FFQL (Flatfile Query Language) is Flatfile's custom query language used for filtering data in <Tooltip tip="A collection of fields...">[Sheets](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip>.
It's logical, composable, and human-readable.

## Overview

Here's an example request for searching for rows where the First Name column is "Bender" and the Last Name column is "Rodriguez".
:

```sql GET sheets/<sheetId>/records request
GET sheets/<sheetId>/records?q=first_name eq Bender and last_name eq Rodriguez
```

```sql query
first_name eq Bender and last_name eq Rodriguez
```

---

## Syntax

The basic syntax of FFQL is:

```sql
[field name] <operator> <value>
```

### Field Name

`field name` is optional and excluding a field name will search across all fields. For example: `eq "Planet Express"` will search across all fields for that value.
`field name` can be the field key or the field label.

Labels or values with spaces should be wrapped in quotes. For example: `name eq "Bender Rodriguez"`, or `"First Name" eq Bender`.

### Operators

FFQL operators are:

- `eq` - Equals (exact match)
- `ne` - Not Equal
- `lt` - Less Than
- `gt` - Greater Than
- `lte` - Less Than or Equal To
- `gte` - Greater Than or Equal To
- `like` - (Case Sensitive) Like
- `ilike` - (Case Insensitive) Like

Both `like` and `ilike` support the following wildcards:

- `%` - Matches any number of characters
- `_` - Matches a single character

So, for instance, `like "Bender%"` would match "Bender Rodriguez" and "Bender Bending Rodriguez".

### Logical Operators

FFQL supports two logical operators:

- `and` - Returns rows meeting both conditions
- `or` - Returns rows meeting either conditions (inclusive)

### The `is` Operator

You can query for message statuses by using the `is` operator. For example: `is error` returns all the rows in an `error` state. `is valid` returns all the rows in a `valid` state. `first_name is error` returns the rows where First Name is in an `error` state.

## Constructing Queries

Complex queries are possible using a combination of operators:

```sql
(
    email like "@gmail.com"
    and (
        "Subscription Status" eq "On-Hold"
        or "Subscription Status" eq "Pending"
    )
    and login_attempts gte 5
)
or is warning
```

This query would return all the rows that:

1. Have a Gmail email address,
2. Have a Subscription Status of "On-Hold" or "Pending",
3. And have more than 5 login attempts.

<Note>It will also include any rows that have a "Warning" message status.</Note>

---

## Usage

FFQL queries can be passed to any <Tooltip tip="View API reference">[REST API](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api)</Tooltip> endpoint that supports the `q` parameter.

Here's an example **cURL** request using the `sheets/<sheetId>/records` endpoint:

```shell Shell / cURL
curl --location 'https://platform.flatfile.com/api/sheets/us_sh_12345678/records?q="Subscription Status" eq "On-Hold" or "Subscription Status" eq "Pending"' \
    --header 'Accept: */*' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <bearer token>'
```

Make sure to [encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_encoding) percent characters if you use them.
