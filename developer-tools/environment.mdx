<Tooltip tip="Learn more about Environments">[Environments](../developer-tools/environment)</Tooltip> are isolated entities and are intended to be a safe place to create and test different configurations. 
A `development` and `production` environment are created on default.

Environments have two guest authentication types: 

1. `magic_link` sends your guests an email with a magic link to login.
2. `shared_link` makes the Space url public, and is used with embedded Flatfile.

If `guestAuthentication` is left undefined, we default to enabling both `magic_link` and `shared_link`.
`guestAuthentication` can be set at both the Environment level and at the Space level. The Space level setting overrides the Environment level setting. 

| isProd | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *false* | `development` | Use this default environment, and it’s associated test API keys, as you build with Flatfile. |
| *true* | `production` | When you're ready to launch, create a new environment and swap out your keys. |

<Note>The development environment does not count towards your paid credits.</Note>

## Secret and publishable keys

All Accounts have two key types for each environment. Learn when to use each type of key:

| Type | Id | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secret key | `sk_23ghsyuyshs7dcrty` | **On the server-side:** Store this securely in your server-side code. Don’t expose this key in an application. |
| Publishable key | `pk_23ghsyuyshs7dcert` | **On the client-side:** Can be publicly-accessible in your application's client-side code. Use when embedding Flatfile. |
