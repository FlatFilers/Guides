<Info>API keys are created automatically. Use the [Developers Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to reveal your API keys for each Environment.</Info>

Flatfile provides two different kinds of environment-specific API keys you can use to interact with the API. In addition, you can work with a development key or a production environment.

Read on to learn more about how to think about which keys to use and how to test in development mode.


## Testing and development

<Tooltip tip="Learn more about Environments">[Environments](../environment)</Tooltip> are isolated entities and are intended to be a safe place to create and test different configurations. 
A `development` and `production` environment are created by default.

| isProd | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *false* | `development` | Use this default environment, and its associated test API keys, as you build with Flatfile. |
| *true* | `production` | When you're ready to launch, create a new environment and swap out your keys. |

<Note>The development environment does not count towards your paid credits.</Note>

## Secret and publishable keys

All Accounts have two key types for each environment. Learn when to use each type of key:

| Type | Id | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secret key | `sk_23ghsyuyshs7dcrty` | **On the server-side:** Store this securely in your server-side code. Don’t expose this key in an application. |
| Publishable key | `pk_23ghsyuyshs7dcert` | **On the client-side:** Can be publicly-accessible in your application's client-side code. Use when embedding Flatfile. |
