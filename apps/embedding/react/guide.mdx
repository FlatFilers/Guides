## Quickstart

### Create a new Space

In this Guide, we'll create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred and is the easiest way to get started with Flatfile.

#### Choose your path

First, decide if you want to start from scratch or make changes to an existing project. Most developers find it easier to clone and start from a working example.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Start from a working React example"
    href="https://github.com/FlatFilers/create-flatfile-react"
    icon="react"
  >
    Clone the create-flatfile-react example project in GitHub.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Start from a working Nextjs example"
    href="https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-nextjs"
    icon="star"
  >
    Alternately, clone the flatfile-nextjs example project in GitHub.

    Set up an embedded Flatfile Workbook from beginning to end.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Advanced mode

### Reuse an existing Space

Choose this option when users might need to wait or can't finish in one go. This is
great for keeping work context and letting users continue where they left
off until the task is done.
