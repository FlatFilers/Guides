# Sheet Component Overview

The `Sheet` component is a fundamental part of the `@flatfile/react` package, designed to handle the configuration and management of a single data sheet within a Flatfile import process. It provides a declarative way to define the structure, validation, and manipulation of data records.

## Main Props

- `config`: An object that defines the sheet's configuration, including its name, slug, and fields.

  - `name`: The human-readable name of the sheet.
  - `slug`: A unique identifier for the sheet, used for referencing in the import process.
  - `fields`: An array of objects defining the structure and constraints of each field in the sheet.

- `onSubmit`: A callback function that is invoked when the sheet's data is successfully submitted. It receives the submitted data as an argument.

- `onRecordHook`: A function that allows for custom manipulation of each record during the import process. It is called for each record and can modify, validate, or enrich the record data.

- `submitSettings`: An object for customizing the behavior of the sheet's submission process, such as handling errors or setting a completion message.

Example usage:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const sheetConfig: Flatfile.SheetConfig = {
    name: "Users",
    slug: "users",
    fields: [
      { key: "name", label: "Name", type: "string" },
      { key: "email", label: "Email", type: "string" },
    ],
  };
  const handleSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log("Submitted data:", data);
  };
  const handleRecord = (record) => {
    record.set("name", record.get("name").toUpperCase());
  };
  return (
    <Sheet
      config={sheetConfig}
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
      onRecordHook={handleRecord}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the `Sheet` component is configured with a `config` object that defines the structure of the "Users" sheet. The `onSubmit` callback logs the submitted data, while the `onRecordHook` function modifies each record by converting the "name" field to uppercase.

The `Sheet` component simplifies the process of defining and managing data sheets within a Flatfile import workflow, making it easier to create custom import experiences in your React application.
