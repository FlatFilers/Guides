# FlatfileProvider Component Overview

`FlatfileProvider` is a context provider for the `@flatfile/react` package that wraps your application's components where Flatfile's import functionality will be used. It initializes and provides the Flatfile import system to its child components.

## Main Props

- `publishableKey`: The key provided by Flatfile to authenticate your application.
- `accessToken`: An alternative to `publishableKey` for authentication, typically used for server-side operations.
- `children`: React nodes for nested components, which can include `Space`, `Workbook`, or `Sheet` components.

Example usage:

```jsx
<FlatfileProvider publishableKey="your-publishable-key">
  <YourComponent />
</FlatfileProvider>
```

This setup allows you to manage and interact with Flatfile imports seamlessly across your application.
