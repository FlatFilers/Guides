# Workbook Component Overview

The `Workbook` component is a key part of the `@flatfile/react` package, designed to manage multiple `Sheet` components as a collection. It represents a workbook within Flatfile's import system, allowing for the configuration of multiple sheets and associated actions.

## Main Props

- `config`: Configuration for the workbook, including its sheets and actions.
- `onSubmit`: Callback function executed when the workbook is submitted.
- `onRecordHooks`: Array of hooks for custom record processing.
- `children`: React nodes for nested components, typically `Sheet` components.

Example usage:

```tsx
<Workbook
  config={workbookConfig}
  onSubmit={handleWorkbookSubmit}
  onRecordHooks={recordHooksArray}
>
  <Sheet config={sheetConfig} />
</Workbook>
```
