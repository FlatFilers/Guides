# Space Component Overview

The `Space` component within the `@flatfile/react` package is used to define a workspace in Flatfile's import system. It encapsulates `Workbook` components and provides a context for the entire import process.

## Main Props

- `config`: Sets up the configuration for a new space, including theming and metadata.
- `id`: An optional prop that, when provided, indicates the specific existing space to be reused instead of creating a new one.
- `children`: React nodes for nested components, typically `Workbook`, `Sheet`, or `Document` components.

Example usage:

```tsx
<Space config={spaceConfig}>
    <Workbook config={workbookConfig} />
</Space>
```
