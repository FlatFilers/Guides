For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one session, create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred.

## Before you begin

<Snippet file="shared/pk_needed.mdx" />

## Prepare your project

### Install packages

Make a new directory.

```bash
mkdir example-flatfile-js-embed
```

Go into that directory.

```bash
cd example-flatfile-js-embed
```

Follow prompts from the `init` command.

```bash
npm init
```

Install packages. (We'll use `parcel` for bundling.)

```bash
npm i @flatfile/javascript @flatfile/listener @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/api flatfile
```

Install dev packages.

```bash
npm i parcel --save-dev
```

### Create your file structure

Setup your app to look something like this:

```
├── public/
   └── index.html
   └── styles.css
├── src/
   └── client.js
   └── workbook.js
   └── listener.js
├── package.json <--- already created
└── package-lock.json <--- already created
```

In this file structure, your app should have two main directories, `public` and `src.`

The `public` directory contains the `index.html` file, which is the entry point of the application's front-end, and the "style.css" file for styling the iframe.

The `src` directory contains the main components and logic of the application, including the `client.js` file, which initializes Flatfile and passes in available options.

## Build your importer

### 1. Add a Flatfile button

Add a button to your application to open Flatfile in a modal. Pass in your `publishableKey` and a new Space will be created on each page load. Also, add the content here to your `styles.css`.

<CodeGroup>
```html public/index.html (snippet)
<button
  onclick="openFlatfile({ publishableKey: 'pk_1234', environmentId: 'us_env_1234' })"
>
  Create new Space
</button>
```

```html public/index.html (full page)
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
    <script type="module" src="../src/client.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="content">
        <h2><code>&lt;Flatfile /&gt;</code></h2>
        <p>Embed Flatfile in just a few lines of code.</p>

        <!-- Button to trigger the modal -->
        <div>
          <!-- Note: PUT YOUR KEY AND ENVIRONMENT_ID IN HERE -->
          <button
            class="contrast"
            onclick="openFlatfile({ publishableKey: 'pk_1234', environmentId: 'us_env_1234' })"
          >
            Create new Space
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="flatfile_iFrameContainer"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Snippet file="shared/iframeStyles.mdx" />

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Initialize Flatfile

In your `client.js`, at minimum, you'll need to receive the `publishableKey` and the `environmentId` set from when you called `openFlatfile`.

```js src/client.js
import { initializeFlatfile } from "@flatfile/javascript";

//create a new space in modal
window.openFlatfile = ({ publishableKey, environmentId }) => {
  if (!publishableKey && !environmentId) {
    throw new Error(
      "You must provide a publishable key and an environment ID - pass through in index.html"
    );
  }
  const flatfileOptions = {
    name: "Embedded Space",
    publishableKey,
    environmentId,
    sidebarConfig: {
      showSidebar: false,
    },
    closeSpace: {
      operation: "submitActionFg",
      onClose: () => setShowSpace(false),
    },
    // Additional props...
  };

  initializeFlatfile(flatfileOptions);
};
```

### 3. Start your client

Now, start your front end by heading to terminal and running the following command. To see that it’s running, visit: https://localhost:1234 (or the port it is running on) and you should see your page and a button. Click the button and see that an empty Space gets created.

```bash
npx parcel public/index.html
```

<Snippet file="shared/embedded_listener.mdx" />

### 8. Customize
