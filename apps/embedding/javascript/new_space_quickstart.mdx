For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one session, create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred.

## Before you begin

<Snippet file="shared/pk_needed.mdx" />

## Prepare your project

### Create your file structure

Setup your app to look something like this:

```
├── public/
   └── index.html
   └── styles.css
├── src/
   └── blueprint.js
```

In this file structure, your app should have two main directories, `public` and `src`.

The `public` directory contains the `index.html` file, which is the entry point of the application's front-end, and the "style.css" file for styling the iframe.

The `src` directory contains the main components and logic of the application, including the `blueprint.js` file, which defines your schema.

## Build your importer

### 1. Initialize Flatfile

Initialize Flatfile to open in a modal. Pass in your `publishableKey` and a new Space will be created on each page load. Also, add the content here to your `styles.css`.

<CodeGroup>

```html public/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@flatfile/javascript@^0.3.1/dist/index.cjs"></script>
    <script type="module" src="../src/blueprint.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./styles.css" />

    <script>
      window.onload = function () {
        FlatFileJavaScript.startFlatfile({
          publishableKey: "pk_1234",
          spaceBody: {
            namespace: "portal",
          },
        });
      };
    </script>
  </head>
</html>
```

<Snippet file="shared/iframeStyles.mdx" />

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Run in browser

Now, open `index.html` in a browser. You should see that Flatfile opens on page load and an empty Space gets created.

### 8. Customize

You can stop here or you can [view our full reference](../reference/common) to see all the ways you can customize your importer.
