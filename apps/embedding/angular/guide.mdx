## Quickstart

In this guide, we'll utilize a straightforward setup. This approach allows you to implement features using the most basic and user-friendly options available.

#### Choose your path

First, decide if you want to start from scratch or make changes to an existing project. Most developers find it easier to clone and start from a working example.

    Clone the create-flatfile-angular example project in GitHub.

    Set up an embedded Flatfile Workbook from beginning to end.

## Advanced mode

### Create a new Space

In this Guide, we'll create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred and is the easiest way to get started with Flatfile.

You'll setup a full localhost project end to end using a listener for maximum control.

### Reuse an existing Space

Choose this option when users might need to wait or can't finish in one go. This is
great for keeping work context and letting users continue where they left
off until the task is done.
