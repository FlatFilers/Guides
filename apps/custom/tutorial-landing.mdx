Welcome to Flatfile! This tutorial will guide you through creating a custom app on Flatfile's powerful platform.

## Before your begin

If you don't already have one, sign up for a Flatfile account [here](https://platform.flatfile.com/account/sign-up).

<Note>
  To go through this tutorial you'll need a Flatfile account. We'll be using the
  credentials from your free account to assemble your first data import
  experience.
</Note>

In your account use the quickcopy button to copy your secrets key from the [API Keys & Secrets](https://platform.flatfile.com/dashboard/keys-and-secrets) page. You're about to use this credential to setup a listener in your account.

## Creating a custom app

In your Flatfile dashboard, click the **+** next to the Platform Apps header to create a custom app. Name is `red` for the sake of this demonstration.

<Tip>
  Take note of the **namespace** that was auto-generated from the name of your
  App. It should be `red`. You'll need this soon.
</Tip>

## Building your custom app

Building a basic data import experience with Flatfile involves a four-step process:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Setup a listener"
    href="../custom/meet-the-listener"
    icon="circle-1"
  >
    Import and extract your data
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Configure a Space"
    href="../custom/meet-the-workbook"
    icon="circle-2"
  >
    Configure your data destination
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Transform and validate data"
    href="../custom/add-data-transformation"
    icon="circle-3"
  >
    Process your data
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Configure a submit Action"
    href="../custom/submit-action"
    icon="circle-4"
  >
    Export your data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

During this guided tutorial you'll learn about key concepts and features of Flatfile,
and get familiar with the tooling Flatfile provides to help developers build the best possible data import experience for your users.

## Next steps

Let's get started by configuring a listener you'll use later: [Setup a Listener](../custom/meet-the-listener).
