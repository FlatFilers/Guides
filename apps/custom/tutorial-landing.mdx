## Creating a custom app

In your Flatfile dashboard, click the + next to the Platform Apps header to create a custom app. Take note of the namespace that was auto-generated from the name of your App.

## Building your custom app

Welcome to Flatfile! This tutorial will guide you through creating a custom app on Flatfile's powerful platform. Building a basic data import experience with Flatfile involves a four-step process:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Setup a listener"
    href="../custom/meet-the-listener"
    icon="circle-1"
  >
    Import and extract your data
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Meet the Workbook"
    href="../custom/meet-the-workbook"
    icon="circle-2"
  >
    Configure your data destination
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Transform and validate data"
    href="../custom/add-data-transformation"
    icon="circle-3"
  >
    Process your data
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Configure a submit Action"
    href="../custom/submit-action"
    icon="circle-4"
  >
    Export your data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

During this guided tutorial you'll learn about key concepts and features of Flatfile,
and get familiar with the tooling Flatfile provides to help developers build the best possible data import experience for your users.

## Next steps

Let's get started by configuring a data destination: [Meet the Workbook](../custom/meet-the-workbook).
