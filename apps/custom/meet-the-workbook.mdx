Flatfile Spaces are micro-applications, each having their own database, filestore, and auth. A Space is comprised of Workbooks, Files and Users. It can also include Documents, Themes and Metadata.

In this example, we'll create a simple Space with a Workbook and a Document. We'll also theme the Space to be red.

## Dynamically build your Space

When the "Create New Space" button is clicked from within your App in the dashboard, it triggers a [job `event`](../../orchestration/events) within the **space** `domain` that initiates a **configure** `operation`.

This operation is analogous to performing a POST request to the endpoint [/api/v1/spaces](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/api/25e20c8ab61c5-create-a-space) with the parameter `autoconfigure` set to true.

#### Usage

In the following code, we will:

1. Filter on the `red` namespace. (Or replace this with your namespace.)
2. Filter for a job by the `domain` (space) and the `operation` (configure) it was created.
3. Listen for a [`job:ready`](../../orchestration/events#job-ready) event.
4. Acknowledge the Job and mark the progress.
5. Add the contents of the Space, including one Workbook and a simple Document.
6. Update the space theme to be the color `red`.
7. Complete (or fail) the job.

```jsx listener.js
import api from "@flatfile/api";
import { configureSpace } from "@flatfile/plugin-space-configure";

export default function (listener) {
  listener.namespace(["space:red"], (red) => {
    red.on(
      "job:ready",
      { job: "space:configure" },
      async ({ context: { spaceId, environmentId, jobId } }) => {
        try {
          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
            info: "Gettin started.",
            progress: 10,
          });

          await api.workbooks.create({
            spaceId,
            name: "My First Workbook",
            labels: ["simple-demo"],
            sheets: [

## Meet your Space

So what did that just do?

In your Flatfile account you should now be able to see your Space.

As you can see, this Space has a Workbook with a sheet and fields. A <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](https://flatfileinc.mintlify.dev/docs/orchestration/workbooks)</Tooltip> is like a template, it's definition includes a profile of the data it expects to hold. We call that profile a Blueprint.

<Note>
  [Blueprint](../../blueprint/overview) is Flatfile's robust data definition
  language (DDL) that emphasizes validation and data preparation. Flatfile APIs
  leverage Blueprint for their create, update, and read operations.
</Note>

## Watch your Events

Because your listener was running, it logged your activity as the Space was being built. You should see several events that took place.

Now, to watch your listener receive another event, make a few changes in the Workbook. For example, try typing text into a cell.

Typing in a cell (editing a Record) triggers an Event!

```ssh console
 ▶ commit:created  10:13:05.159 AM us_evt_1234
 ↳ on(**, {})
 ↳ on(commit:created, {"sheetSlug":"contacts"})

---

## Next steps

Now that you have a Workbook in a Space, which acts both as a schema and destination for your data, you're ready to [Add data transformations](../custom/add-data-transformation.mdx).
