<Info>API keys are created automatically. Use the [Developers Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to reveal your API keys for each Environment.</Info>

Flatfile provides two different kinds of environment-specific API keys you can use to interact with the API.

- The **Secret Key** should be protected and used with requests made from server-side logic only.
- The **Publishable Key** is safe to include in a browser. It can only be used to create a new import space.



## Testing and development

<Tooltip tip="Learn more about Environments">[Environments](hello.com)</Tooltip> are isolated entities and are intended to be a safe place to create and test different configurations. `development` and `production` environments are created by default.

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test | `development` | Use this default environment, and it’s associated test API keys, as you build with Flatfile. |
| Live | `production` | When you're ready to launch, create a new environment and swap out your keys. |

## Secret and publishable keys

All Accounts have two key types for each environment. Learn when to use each type of key:

| Type | Id | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secret key | `sk_23ghsyuyshs7dcrty` | **On the server-side:** Store this securely in your server-side code. Don’t expose this key in an application. |
| Publishable key | `pk_23ghsyuyshs7dcert` | **On the client-side:** Can be publicly-accessible in your application's client-side code. Use when embedding Flatfile. |
