title: "Custom Actions"
description: "Trigger operations based on user input."

A Custom Action is a code-based operation that runs where that action is mounted. Actions run when a user clicks the corresponding user prompt in Flatfile.

<Info>
Flatfile currently allows you to attach a Custom Action to a Sheet and/or a Workbook. Coming soon: Custom Actions on Workbooks, Files, Documents, & Spaces; input forms for Custom Actions.

## Sheet-mounted Custom Actions

Once a user has extracted and mapped data into a <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Sheets">[Sheet](../concepts/workbooks#sheets-array)</Tooltip>, it may be better to run an operation on the entire data set, instead of making atomic transformations at the record- or cell-level. For example:
* Sending a webhook that notifies your API of the data's readiness
* Populating the Sheet with data from another source
* Adding two different fields together after a user review's initial validation checks
* Moving valid data from an editable Sheet to a read-only Sheet

Sheet-mounted Custom Actions are represented in two forms:

### Dropdown

ADD SCREENSHOT HERE - DROPDOWN OF CUSTOM ACTIONS

By default, all Custom Actions are included in a drop-down in the Sheet header.

### Primary call to action

If you configure `primary: true` on a Custom Action, it will be represented as a button in the Sheet.

### How to mount a Sheet-level Custom Action

```jsx  
actions: [
  {
    "slug": "download_as_pdf",
    "label": "Download as PDF",
    "type": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "primary": true
  },
  {...}
]
```

Sheet-level Custom Actions are configured within a <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Blueprint](../concepts/workbooks#blueprint-object)</Tooltip>. The executable code within an Action is compiled into a <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Job](../concepts/jobs)</Tooltip> and can run asyncronously or immediately.
