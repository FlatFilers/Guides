## [@flatfile/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/react)

Embed React is a front-end SDK wrapper around the [Flatfile API](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10/). It allows you to securely and easily add an embedded import experience to any React app.
This powerful iframe tool is designed to seamlessly integrate into your website or application, providing a simple yet robust experience for collecting and transforming data from your customers.

To find the additional Flatfile integration paths that may work better for your business, explore our [docs](https://flatfile.stoplight.io).

## Before you begin

The minimum supported version of React is v16. If you use an older version, upgrade React to use this library. You will also need Node.js v18 installed on your machine.

Check your versions in terminal:

```npm
node --version
npm view react version
```

### Setup

Install Embed React from the npm public registry.

```npm
npm install @flatfile/react@5.0.8
```

```yarn
yarn install @flatfile/react@5.0.8
```

### Get your Publishable Key

<Info>
  API keys are created automatically. Use the [Developers
  Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to reveal your API keys for
  each Environment.
</Info>

Copy your publishable key from the dashboard under [Developers Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to be used in the next step.
This key is safe to be used in client-side applications as it has limited access to the Flatfile API. For more on authentication, see [Authentication](../developer-tools/security/authentication).

## Build

### Space component

When you launch an embedded importer, you're actually launching an entire Space for that Guest.

The `useSpace` hook returns a Space component. By using this hook versus mounting directly, you are able to check for any errors before rendering the component.

**Error handling**: If something internal to the Space component throws an error, we return it via **error** or the Space component if it builds correctly. This allows you to render your own error state.

## Lifecycle

**onSubmit:** This callback function is called when the user submits data using the primary action (upper right hand corner of Space) from within the iframe. It is typically used to perform actions on the submitted data, such as validating it or sending it to a server.
This function does not close the iframe.

**onComplete:** This callback function is called when the submit action is complete and closes the iframe. **Internally, we archive the space when onComplete is called.** It can also be used to perform cleanup actions, such as resetting the state of the parent application or updating the UI.

## Customization

### makeTheme helper function

The `makeTheme` helper function accepts three values (primaryColor, textColor, logo). From there, we programmatically create a nice looking theme for you. If you need more control, add raw values instead.

**Error handling**: Internally, our `makeTheme` helper validates that the colors passed in are valid colors. This means they can be correctly parsed. (Names, rgb, hsv, hex)

```typescript
const theme = makeTheme({
  primaryColor: "red",
  textColor: "white",
  logo: "https://images.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/gL6Blz3kTPdZXWknuIDVx/7bb7c73d93b111ed542d2ed426b42fd5/flatfile.svg",
});
```

```typescript Example passed to useSpace hook
const {
  error,
  data: { component },
} = useSpace({
  themeConfig: theme,
  publishableKey,
  environmentId,
  workbook,
  workbookName,
});
```

```typescript Example passed to Space
<Space
  themeConfig={theme}
  publishableKey={publishableKey}
  environmentId={environmentId}
  workbook={workbook}
  workbookName={workbookName}
  {...props}
/>
```

<br />

| Prop           | Type     | Description         | Required |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `primaryColor` | `string` | Primary brand color | no       |
| `textColor`    | `string` | Text color          | no       |

### Manual CSS overrides

Instead of passing two colors to `makeTheme` and letting us construct a theme for you, you can access each individual CSS variable that we use in the dashboard. Just adhere to the types defined in the [Theming Reference](../how-to/theming).

## Guest Sidebar

You can customize your guest sidebar using the [Sidebar Reference](../how-to/guest_sidebar) or you can hide it completely (most common). Pass your sidebar configuration to your `useSpace` hook or `Space` component.

```typescript
const mySidebarConfig = {
  showDataChecklist: false,
  defaultPage: {
    workbook: {
      workbookId: "123",
      sheetId: "123",
    },
  },
};
```

```typescript Example passed to useSpace hook
const {
  error,
  data: { component },
} = useSpace({
  sidebarConfig: mySidebarConfig,
  publishableKey,
  environmentId,
  workbook,
  workbookName,
});
```

| `showSidebar`           | `boolean`                                                                      | Toggle whether sidebar defaults to open inside of a Workbook. Defaults to false.                    |

## Documents

[Documents]('../how-to/documents), written in Markdown, provide extra clarification and instructions to users of a Space. Each Document will appear in the sidebar of a Space. Standard syntax is supported.

```typescript
const mainDocument = {
  title: "Getting Started",
  body:
    "![Shop](https://coconut.show/logo-big.png)\n" +
    "\\\n" +
    "&nbsp;\n" +
    "\n" +
    "---\n" +
    "\n" +
    "# Welcome to the Surf Shop!\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Please upload your contacts to the Surf Shop using the Files menu on the left.\n",
};
```

```typescript Example passed to useSpace hook
const {
  error,
  data: { component },
} = useSpace({
  publishableKey,
  sidebarConfig: mySidebarConfig,
  publishableKey,
  environmentId,
  document: mainDocument,
  workbook,
  workbookName,
});
```
