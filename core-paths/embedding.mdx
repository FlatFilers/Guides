Embed React is a front-end SDK wrapper around the [Flatfile API](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/). It allows you to securely and easily add an embedded data import experience, also known as a [Space](/concepts/spaces), to any React app.

Using an iframe, Embed React seamlessly integrates into your website or application, providing a simple yet robust experience for collecting and transforming data from your customers.

<Info>
Prerequisites: You'll need a Flatfile account and your [publishable key](../developer-tools/security/authentication#secret-and-publishable-keys) to complete this tutorial. [Sign up](https://platform.flatfile.com/account/sign-up) and use the publishable key from your `development` environment for this tutorial.
</Info>

## Before you begin

The minimum supported version id **React v16**.

### Check versions

Check your versions in terminal. If you use an older version, you'll need to upgrade.

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
npm view react version
```

```yarn yarn
yarn list --version react
```

</CodeGroup>

### Install the package

Install Embed React from the npm public registry.

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
npm install @flatfile/react@latest
```

```yarn yarn
yarn install @flatfile/react@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

### Authenticate

<Info>
  API keys are created automatically. Use the [Developers
  Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to reveal your publishable key for
  each Environment. Learn more about [Authentication](../developer-tools/security/authentication).
</Info>

The publishable key is safe to be used in client-side applications as it has limited access to the Flatfile API. 
Copy your `publishable key` and `environment id` from the dashboard to a notepad.
You'll need these in the next step.

## Recap & Next Steps

In the next step, we will get started building our embedded Flatfile using an iFrame.
