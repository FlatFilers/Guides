Embed React is a front-end SDK wrapper around the [Flatfile API](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/). It allows you to securely and easily add an embedded data import experience, also known as a [Space](/concepts/spaces), to any React app.

Using an iframe, Embed React seamlessly integrates into your website or application, providing a simple yet robust experience for collecting and transforming data from your customers.

## Before you begin

The minimum supported version of React is v16. If you use an older version, upgrade React to use this library. You will also need Node.js v18 installed on your machine.

Check your versions in terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
node --version
npm view react version
```

```yarn yarn
yarn list --version react
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setup

Install Embed React from the npm public registry.

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
npm install @flatfile/react@6.0
```

```yarn yarn
yarn install @flatfile/react@6.0
```

</CodeGroup>

### Get your Environment ID and Publishable Key

<Info>
  API keys are created automatically. Use the [Developers
  Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to reveal your API keys for
  each Environment.
</Info>

Copy your **publishable key** and **environment id** from the dashboard under [Developers Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers).

Your environment id and publishable key will look like this:

```
us_env_abc123 // environmentId
pk_xyz789 // publishableKey
```

The publishable key is safe to be used in client-side applications as it has limited access to the Flatfile API. For more on authentication, see [Authentication](../developer-tools/security/authentication).

<Warning>Do not use your secret key to embed Flatfile.</Warning>
