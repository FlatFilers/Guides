## [@flatfile/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/react)

Embed React is a front-end SDK wrapper around the [Flatfile API](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/). It allows you to securely and easily add an embedded import experience to any React app.
This powerful iframe tool is designed to seamlessly integrate into your website or application, providing a simple yet robust experience for collecting and transforming data from your customers.

## Before you begin

The minimum supported version of React is v16. If you use an older version, upgrade React to use this library. You will also need Node.js v18 installed on your machine.

Check your versions in terminal:

```npm
node --version
npm view react version
```

### Setup

Install Embed React from the npm public registry.

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
npm install @flatfile/react@5.0.8
```

```yarn yarn
yarn install @flatfile/react@5.0.8
```

</CodeGroup>

### Get your Publishable Key

<Info>
  API keys are created automatically. Use the [Developers
  Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to reveal your API keys for
  each Environment.
</Info>

Copy your **publishable key** from the dashboard under [Developers Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to be used in the Build step.
This key is safe to be used in client-side applications as it has limited access to the Flatfile API. For more on authentication, see [Authentication](../security/authentication).

### Get your Environment Id

Copy your **environment id** from the dashboard under [Developers Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to be used in the Build step.

## Build

Before getting started with the embedded experience, it is important to consider two concepts:

1. The space component which has <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbooks](../concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip>
2. <Tooltip tip="Anatomy of an Event...">[Events](../concepts/events)</Tooltip> which
   enables workbooks to have asynchronous and customizable jobs to happen either
   behind the scenes or be triggered upon user interaction.

_In the examples below, you will see these events mentioned above being passed in as `client` to the `useSpace` hook._

### Space component

When you launch an embedded importer, you're actually launching an entire Space for that Guest.

The `useSpace` hook returns a Space component which has internal <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbooks](../concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip>.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript ExampleApp
import { ISpace } from "@flatfile/react";
import { makeTheme } from "@flatfile/react";
import { useSpace } from "@flatfile/react";

const ExampleApp = () => {
const [showSpace, setShowSpace] = useState(false);

const spaceProps: ISpace = {
name: "Embedded Space",
workbookName: "Employees workbook",
publishableKey: "your-publishable-key",
environmentId: "your-env-id",
workbook: config,
themeConfig: makeTheme({ primaryColor: "#546a76", textColor: "#fff" }),
sidebarConfig: {
showDataChecklist: false,
showSidebar: false,
},
archiveSpaceOn: "TestSheet:join-field",
onComplete: () => setShowSpace(false),
onSubmit: () => console.log("submitting"),
client: joinFieldClient,
};

const { error, data } = useSpace({
...spaceProps,
});

return (

<div style={{ padding: "16px" }}>
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      setShowSpace(!showSpace);
    }}
  >
    {showSpace === true ? "Close" : "Open"} space
  </button>
  {error && <div>{`ðŸš« ${error}`}</div>}
  {showSpace && data?.component}
</div>
); };

````

```typescript Example Workbook

import { Client } from '@flatfile/listener'
import { Flatfile } from '@flatfile/api'

export const config: Flatfile.SheetConfig[] = [
  {
    name: 'TestSheet',
    slug: 'TestSheet',
    fields: [
      {
        key: 'first_name',
        type: 'string',
        label: 'First name',
        constraints: [
          {
            type: 'required'
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        key: 'last_name',
        type: 'string',
        label: 'last name',
        constraints: [
          {
            type: 'unique'
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        key: 'full_name',
        type: 'string',
        label: 'full name'
      }
    ],
    actions: [
      {
        slug: 'join-field',
        label: 'Join field',
        primary: true
      }
    ]
  }
]

```

```typescript Example client

/**
 * Example Client that runs join field on action 'Join field'
 */
export const joinFieldClient = Client.create((client) => {
  client.on(
    'action:triggered',
    // @ts-ignore
    { context: { sheetSlug: 'TestSheet' } },
    async (event) => {
      const { sheetId, versionId } = event.context

      try {
        const {
          data: { records }
        } = await event.api.getRecords({
          sheetId,
          versionId
        })

        if (!records) return

        // Populate full name field
        const recordsUpdates = records?.map((record: any) => {
          const fullName =
            record.values['first_name'].value + record.values['last_name'].value

          record.values['full_name'].value = fullName

          return record
        })

        console.log('updates', { recordsUpdates })

        await event.api.updateRecords({
          sheetId,
          recordsUpdates
        })
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(
          `Error updating records - Use console logs inside your events to further debug: ${e}`
        )
      }
    }
  )
})

#### Error handling

Our component comes equipped with robust error handling capabilities, ensuring that unexpected errors do not disrupt the user experience.
By default, the component will render an error component with the error message when an error is encountered, providing your users with clear feedback on what went wrong.

However, we also understand that different applications may have unique error handling needs.Therefore, we have designed our component to be highly customizable.
If you would like to use your own error handling component instead of the default one, simply pass it in as the `error` prop when rendering the component.
This allows you to seamlessly integrate our component with your application's existing error handling infrastructure, while still benefiting from our core error handling functionality.

#### Loading state

Similar to error handling, if you choose to use a custom loader, you can pass it in as the `loading` prop when rendering the component.
If no loader component is passed in, our default loader will be used. This gives you the flexibility to choose the loading experience that is best suited for your application's needs.

## Lifecycle

#### `onSubmit`

This callback function is called when the user submits data using the primary action (upper right hand corner of Space) from within the iframe. It is typically used to perform actions on the submitted data, such as validating it or sending it to a server.
This function does not close the iframe.

#### `onComplete`

This callback function is called when the submit action is complete and closes the iframe. **Internally, we archive the space when onComplete is called.** It can also be used to perform cleanup actions, such as resetting the state of the parent application or updating the UI.

## Customization

### Theme

#### makeTheme helper function

The `makeTheme` helper function accepts three values (`primaryColor`, `textColor`, `logo`). From there, we programmatically create a nice looking themed space for you. If you need more control, [add raw values](../guides/theming) instead.

<Tip>
  Internally, our `makeTheme` helper validates that the colors passed in are
  valid colors. This means they can be correctly parsed. (Names, rgb, hsv, hex)
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```typescript makeTheme
const theme = makeTheme({
  primaryColor: "red",
  textColor: "white",
  logo: "https://images.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/gL6Blz3kTPdZXWknuIDVx/7bb7c73d93b111ed542d2ed426b42fd5/flatfile.svg",
});
```

```typescript Example passed to useSpace hook
const {
  error,
  data: { component },
} = useSpace({
  themeConfig: theme,
  publishableKey,
  environmentId,
  workbook,
  workbookName,
});
```

```typescript Example passed to Space
<Space
  themeConfig={theme}
  publishableKey={publishableKey}
  environmentId={environmentId}
  workbook={workbook}
  workbookName={workbookName}
  {...props}
/>
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

| Prop           | Type     | Description         | Required |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `primaryColor` | `string` | Primary brand color | no       |
| `textColor`    | `string` | Text color          | no       |
| `logo`         | `string` | full url to logo    | no       |

#### Manual CSS overrides

Instead of passing two colors to `makeTheme` and letting us construct a theme for you, you can access each individual CSS variable that we use in the dashboard. Just adhere to the types defined in the [Theming Reference](../guides/theming).

### Iframe styles

You may want to style the iframe the space is wrapped in - we've got you covered using the prop `iframeStyles`

This will override the default styles provided by the component and apply your custom styles instead.

When using the `iframeStyle` prop, it is important to note that it accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This design decision is consistent with the way the DOM style JavaScript property functions, which allows for more efficient processing of styles and helps prevent XSS security vulnerabilities.

```typescript
const iframeStyles = {
    width: '100%',
    height: '750px',
    borderWidth: 0,
    borderRadius: '20px',
    background: '#fff',
    padding: '16px'
  }
```

### Collecting additional data

The Space component offers the flexibility to pass in additional metadata through the use of `spaceInfo` prop. This prop allows you to provide information such as user ID, space name, company ID, and company name to the component, which is used to make the dashboard search / filter experience more effective.

To use the `spaceInfo` prop, simply create an object that implements the `ISpaceInfo` interface and pass it in as `spaceInfo` prop when rendering the component.

```typescript
export interface ISpaceInfo {
  userId?: string
  name?: string
  companyId?: string
  companyName?: string
}
```

For example, if you wanted to provide the component with a user ID and space name, you could create an object like this:

```typescript
const spaceInfo: ISpaceInfo = {
  userId: "1234",
  name: "My Space",
}
```

### Guest Sidebar

You can customize your guest sidebar using the [Sidebar Reference](../guides/guest_sidebar) or you can hide it completely (most common). Pass your sidebar configuration to your `useSpace` hook or `Space` component.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript sidebarConfig
const mySidebarConfig = {
  showDataChecklist: false,
  defaultPage: {
    workbook: {
      workbookId: "123",
      sheetId: "123",
    },
  },
};
```

```typescript Example passed to useSpace hook
const {
  error,
  data: { component },
} = useSpace({
  sidebarConfig: mySidebarConfig,
  publishableKey,
  environmentId,
  workbook,
  workbookName,
});
```

</CodeGroup>

| Property                | Type                                                                           | Description                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultPage`           | `{ documentId?: string, workbook?: { workbookId: string, sheetId?: string } }` | Landing page upon loading a space. Defaults to primary workbook.  |
| `showGuestInvite`       | `boolean`                                                                      | Toggle ability to invite guests. Defaults to false.                                                 |
| `showDataChecklist`     | `boolean`                                                                      | Toggle data config for space. Defaults to false.                                                    |
| `showSidebar`           | `boolean`                                                                      | Toggle whether sidebar defaults to open inside of a Workbook. Defaults to false.                    |

## Documents

<Tooltip tip="Standalone webpages...">[Documents]('../guides/documents)</Tooltip>, written in Markdown, provide extra clarification and instructions to users of a Space. Each Document will appear in the sidebar of a Space. Standard syntax is supported.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript documentConfig
const mainDocument = {
  title: "Getting Started",
  body:
    "![Shop](https://coconut.show/logo-big.png)\n" +
    "\\\n" +
    "&nbsp;\n" +
    "\n" +
    "---\n" +
    "\n" +
    "# Welcome to the Surf Shop!\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Please upload your contacts to the Surf Shop using the Files menu on the left.\n",
};
```

```typescript Example passed to useSpace hook
const {
  error,
  data: { component },
} = useSpace({
  publishableKey,
  sidebarConfig: mySidebarConfig,
  publishableKey,
  environmentId,
  document: mainDocument,
  workbook,
  workbookName,
});
```

## Example product use cases

The following are a handful of examples of ways you can validate and transform data using Flatfile.

1. **E-commerce platform:** An e-commerce platform might embed Flatfile to allow their customers to manipulate their product data before importing it into the platform. Their customers can use the tool to make sure every item has a unique SKU, transform all dollar amounts to the same format, and make sure no item has a negative number in inventory.

2. **Marketing automation software:** A marketing automation software might embed Flatfile to allow their customers to validate all email addresses before importing it into the software. Additionally, they can make sure they have a first name for every contact, decide to remove all contacts who don't have a phone number that can recieve text messages, and track opt-ins.

3. **Business intelligence software:** A business intelligence software might embed Flatfile to allow customers to clean up their data before visualizing it in the software. Customers could use the tool to split address to multiple fields from one full address field, make sure no date is before the year 1900, and calculate a unique ID from 3 other identifying fields.

4. **Healthcare software:** A healthcare software might embed Flatfile to allow their hospitals to manipulate patient data before importing it into the software. Customers can use the tool to make sure each patient has a social security number, highlight patients with dependents, and validate a patient has the right codes applied to them.
