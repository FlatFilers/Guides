**Preserve Record IDs During Transformations**

We've added a new `keepRecordIds` flag to maintain record IDs during transformations. This enhancement provides greater control over how records are processed during transformation operations.

**Key Benefits:**
- Maintains data consistency across transformation previews
- Preserves record relationships and references
- Improves transformation accuracy by maintaining original record IDs

**Technical Details:**
When `keepRecordIds` is set to `true`, the system uses `updateRecords` instead of the previous add/delete approach, ensuring that record IDs remain unchanged throughout the transformation process. This is particularly valuable when:
- Working with data that has established relationships between records
- Performing multiple transformations where maintaining record identity is important
- Integrating with systems that rely on consistent record identifiers

**Usage:**
The `keepRecordIds` flag can be included in transformation job configurations:

```javascript
// Example of creating a transformation job with keepRecordIds
const transformationJobResponse = await HTTPService.createJob({
  type: "workbook",
  operation: "transform",
  source: workbookId,
  destination: destinationWorkbookId,
  config: {
    destinationSheetId: destinationSheetId,
  },
  input: {
    programId: "your-program-id",
    version: "v2",
    keepRecordIds: true, // Set to true to preserve record IDs
  },
});
```

This feature is backward compatible - `keepRecordIds` defaults to `false`, maintaining the existing behavior for current implementations.
