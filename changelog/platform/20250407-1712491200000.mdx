title: "Enhanced Guest URL Functionality for DataClips"
description: "Updated guest URL handling for DataClips with improved URL generation"

The guest URL functionality for DataClips has been enhanced with a more streamlined approach to URL generation and storage:

- The `guestAuthentication` array field has been replaced with a new `guestLinkUrl` string field in the DataClip model
- When updating a DataClip with `sharedLink` set to "unrestricted", a guest link with a permanent access token is generated
- When updating a DataClip with `sharedLink` set to "restricted", a direct sheet URL is generated without a token
- The system now properly handles existing guest links to prevent unnecessary regeneration
- The URL format has been improved for better usability and security

This change provides a more consistent and reliable way to share DataClips with guests, with clearer distinction between restricted and unrestricted access modes.
