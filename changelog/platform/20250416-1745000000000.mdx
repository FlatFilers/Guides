title: Advanced Filters Improvements

We've made several enhancements to the advanced filters feature to improve usability and fix various issues:

- Fixed an issue where fields with matching labels would both be selected in the fields dropdown
- Added `nowrap` styling to values, operations, and fields in filter chips to prevent awkward text wrapping
- Resolved an issue where validity tabs weren't correctly set based on initial filter assignment
- Improved input UX for filters that don't depend on specific values (greater than, less than, contains) by providing a dedicated input interface
- Updated visual styling for filter chips for better readability

These improvements make the advanced filtering experience more intuitive and visually consistent, allowing for more efficient data filtering and analysis.
