## DataClip Shared Links

DataClips now support shared links, making it easier to share your data with others. When creating a DataClip, you can now specify the `sharedLinkAccess` parameter to control how your data can be accessed:

- **Restricted (default)**: Creates a guest link that requires authentication
- **Public**: Creates an anonymous access link that can be shared with anyone

The API response now includes:
- `guestLinkUrl`: URL for accessing the DataClip
- `accessToken`: Token for authentication (included when `sharedLinkAccess` is set to Public)

This enhancement makes DataClips more versatile for collaboration and sharing scenarios.

```typescript
// Example: Creating a DataClip with public access
const dataClip = await api.dataClips.create({
  description: "Monthly sales data",
  sourceSheetId: "us_sh_123",
  sharedLinkAccess: "public"
});

// The response includes guestLinkUrl and accessToken
console.log(dataClip.guestLinkUrl); // URL to share
console.log(dataClip.accessToken);  // Access token for authentication
```

You can also retrieve an existing DataClip with a specific access level:

```typescript
// Get a DataClip with public access
const dataClip = await api.dataClips.get(
  "us_dc_123", 
  { sharedLinkAccess: "public" }
);
```
