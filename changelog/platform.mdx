<Update label="02-04-2025" description="dataxp">
Records with readonly configurations are now handled differently in the
replaceRecords operation. A new option called excludeReadOnly has been
introduced to control whether readonly records or fields should be skipped or
replaced. If excludeReadOnly is set to true, records with a readonly config or
fields marked as readonly will not be replaced during the replaceRecords
operation. If excludeReadOnly is false or not provided, readonly records and
fields will be replaced as before.

The findAndReplaceRecords method in the WorkbooksService now checks if the field
being replaced is readonly and throws an error if excludeReadOnly is set to
true, preventing modification of readonly fields.

Several new tests have been added to validate the behavior of the replaceRecords
operation with readonly records and fields, covering scenarios with
excludeReadOnly set to true and false.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The SearchRecordsOptions and GetCellValuesOptions interfaces have been updated
to include the new excludeReadOnly option.

Example usage:

```typescript
// Replace non-readonly records or fields
const records = await wb.op.replaceRecords({
  sheetId: wb.contacts.id,
  options: {},
  find: "John",
  replace: "Jonathan",
  field: { key: "firstName" },
  legacyReplace: false,
  actorId: UserId.make(),
});

// Skip readonly records or fields
const records = await wb.op.replaceRecords({
  sheetId: wb.contacts.id,
  options: { excludeReadOnly: true },
  find: "John",
  replace: "Jonathan",
  field: { key: "firstName" },
  legacyReplace: false,
  actorId: UserId.make(),
});
```
</Update>

</Update>

<Update label="01-30-2025" description="dataxp">
Namespace modification is now supported via API only. Other app fields remain
editable via the UI but the ability to edit a namespace has been removed
post-creation.
</Update>

<Update label="01-30-2025" description="spaces">
Fixes bug where long document titles would overlap the page header.
</Update>

<Update label="01-27-2025" description="dataxp">
The order of imports from the `@flatfile/api` module has been updated. The `RecordUpdates` and `Success` types are now imported in a different order.

The implementation of the `clearColumn` method has been refactored. Instead of using the `map` and `filter` array methods, it now uses the `reduce` method to generate the `recordsUpdates` array. The new implementation checks if the field value exists and if the field is not read-only before clearing it. This change likely improves performance and readability.

The wording of the `info` and `outcome.message` properties in the `transitionJob` call has been updated from "Column was removed" to "Column was cleared". This change provides more accurate messaging about the action performed.

Additionally, the code now handles read-only fields correctly. If a field is marked as read-only in the `RecordConfig`, its value will not be cleared.

These changes improve the functionality, performance, and messaging of the `clearColumn` logic without introducing any breaking changes to the external interface.
</Update>

<Update label="01-23-2025" description="dataxp">
When clearing a column in a job operation, a snapshot of the sheet will be taken
before the column is cleared. This snapshot will be labeled with the specific
column key that is being cleared, providing a record of the sheet state before
the column clearing operation. The snapshot is taken by calling a new utility
function `takeSnapshotForJob`, which handles creating and labeling the snapshot
based on the job, sheet, and column details. This allows developers to review
the sheet state prior to the column clearing if needed.
</Update>

<Update label="01-22-2025" description="dataxp">
The release adds the ability to mark a space as an app template and filter
spaces based on whether they are app templates or not.

This can be used with the new space-configure-from-template plugin to create new
spaces using an existing space as a template.

When using Autobuild for a new App, the space generated during Autobuild will
automatically be tagged as the template for that App.
</Update>

<Update label="01-22-2025" description="dataxp">
The release introduces the ability to filter spaces by the associated app ID
when retrieving a list of spaces. A new query parameter `appId` has been added
to the `/v1/spaces` endpoint. Developers can now pass the `appId` query
parameter to retrieve only the spaces associated with the specified app. For
example, `?appId=us_app_123` will return only spaces linked to the app with ID
`us_app_123`. If an invalid or non-existent app ID is provided, an empty list
will be returned.
</Update>

<Update label="01-17-2025" description="dataxp">
An error is now thrown if attempting to clear a readonly column in a sheet. This
prevents modifying data in readonly columns.

Example:

```
const field = {
  key: 'ReadonlyColumn',
  label: 'Readonly Column',
  type: 'string',
  readonly: true
}
```

Attempting to clear this column will throw an error: 'Column is readonly and
cannot be cleared'.

An error is also thrown if attempting to clear any column in a readonly sheet.
This prevents modifying data in readonly sheets.

Example:

```
const sheet = {
  config: {
    readonly: true,
    fields: [...]
  }
}
```

Attempting to clear a column in this sheet will throw an error: 'Sheet is
readonly. Column cannot be cleared'.

These changes ensure data integrity by preventing unintended modification of
readonly data.
</Update>

<Update label="01-13-2025" description="dataxp">
The `clearColumnAction` now has a constraint added that checks if the column is enabled before allowing the action to be executed. This ensures that the action can only be performed on columns that are currently enabled, preventing any potential issues or errors that could arise from attempting to clear a disabled column.
</Update>

<Update label="01-06-2025" description="spaces">
The manual entry and file upload button shown when the workbook is empty have
has their max width updated so they can support more text.
</Update>

<Update label="12-30-2024" description="dataxp">
Trailing empty records in CSV files will now be trimmed during file extraction.
Empty records in-between records with values will continue to be kept.
</Update>

<Update label="12-20-2024" description="dataxp">
- Record order is now maintained when inserting records
- When using the Flatfile API to add records, the order of those records will
  now be preserved keeping the original sequence as provided
</Update>

<Update label="12-10-2024" description="spaces">
Fixes a bug where AI assist would crash when ‘config’ object or the ‘options’
array is undefined.
</Update>

<Update label="12-09-2024" description="dataxp">
Fixes a bug where an error would be thrown when config options was undefined
during sheet upsert operations.
</Update>

<Update label="12-06-2024" description="dataxp">
There was a bug causing the name of environment secrets not to update when
edited. This fixes the bug ensuring environment secret names are updated.
</Update>

<Update label="12-04-2024" description="spaces">
The `viewMapped` functionality has been updated to include new text strings for
messaging related to updating a table to only view mapped fields. The messages
include "Updating the table to only view mapped fields", "Halfway there, hang
tight...", "Almost done...", "Table update complete. Please audit the data", and
"An error occurred while updating the workbook. See Event Logs." These strings
will be displayed to the user during the process of updating a table to show
only mapped fields, providing status updates and handling potential errors. This
change enhances the user experience by providing clear communication during this
operation.
</Update>

<Update label="12-02-2024" description="dataxp">
A bug fix was made to the handling of enum field options when updating a sheet.
Previously, if the `config.options` property was undefined, an error would
occur. Now, if `config.options` is undefined, it defaults to an empty array.
This ensures that the code can safely handle cases where `config.options` is not
present or is undefined. For example, if a developer was updating a sheet with
an enum field that did not previously have any options defined, the update can
now proceed without errors.
</Update>

<Update label="12-02-2024" description="spaces">
Added three keys: `addColumn`, `clearColumn`, and `removeColumn` with their
respective translations for adding, clearing, and removing columns.

In the English translation file, the title of the “mapValues” section has been
updated from “Map values” to “Map Fields”.
</Update>

<Update label="11-13-2024" description="spaces">
Updates to the mapping flow to prevent a user from accidentally navigating
"back" into a mapping flow after it has already been completed.
</Update>

<Update label="10-28-2024" description="dataxp">
**Bug Fixes in Edit and Create App Forms**

We've resolved several issues affecting the Edit and Create App forms:

- Fixed form validation issues
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced user feedback
</Update>

<Update label="10-17-2024" description="dataxp">
Updated the AutoBuild flow to allow editing the working space name during the
build process. The name can now be edited by clicking an icon next to the space
name, which reveals an input field to enter a new name. The name change is saved
when the input field loses focus or the Enter key is pressed. Added a badge
indicating "Dev Mode" when not in the production environment.

Simplified the loading step by removing the detailed progress indicators and
showing only a centered loader component.

Updated the BlueprintTab component to display a bottom border and align the
blueprint view action icons to the right.
</Update>

<Update label="10-03-2024" description="spaces">
Implemented sheet ordering functionality in the sidebar. Sheets are now
displayed in the order specified by the `sheetSidebarOrder` setting in the
workbook. Any sheets not included in the order are appended to the end.
</Update>

<Update label="10-01-2024" description="dataxp">
The getDataDiff function has been updated to handle array values correctly when
comparing proposed changes with existing source (src) and artifact data.

If the proposed array value is the same as the existing array value in either
the source or artifacts, it will not be included in the changeset returned by
getDataDiff.

The function now uses the lodash isEqual utility to compare array values,
instead of strict equality (===), to account for differences in order or
reference of array elements.

For example, if the proposed tags array is ['jedi', 'sith'], it will not be
included in the changeset if the existing source tags are ['JEDI', 'SITH'] or if
the existing artifact tags are ['jedi', 'sith'], because the values are
considered equal despite differences in capitalization or array order.

This change ensures that unnecessary changes are not included in the changeset
when working with array values, reducing noise and improving the accuracy of the
changeset calculation.
</Update>

<Update label="09-27-2024" description="dataxp">
`@flatfile/api@1.9.17`

Secrets have been updated to introduce new optional fields for filtering.

A new optional `actorId` field of type `ActorId` has been added to the
`ListSecrets` request type and `WriteSecret` type for secrets. This allows
filtering secrets by the associated actor (user, guest, agent, or api key).
</Update>

<Update label="09-25-2024" description="dataxp">
`@flatfile/api@1.9.16`

Added new methods to for managing stored sheet constraints: `getConstraints`,
`createConstraint`, `getConstraintById`, `updateConstraint`, and
`deleteConstraint`.

`@flatfile/api@1.9.15`

With the addition of archived spaces there is now an ability to `unarchiveSpace`
method and `space:unarchived` event.

Deprecated use of metadata field at the cell value level, recommending use of
record level metadata instead.
</Update>

<Update label="09-11-2024" description="spaces-ui">
`spaces-ui`

Updates to Snapshots resource to track changes to a sheet's schema (i.e. added

`@flatfile/api@1.9.14`

#### Actions Resource

Actions are now a first class resource. Developers may now create, retrieve,
update, and delete actions via the api. New action events ActionCreated,
ActionUpdated, and ActionDeleted are now being published and an actionId field
has been added to the Context of events.

#### Agent Versioning

Agents versioning has been introduced. You may now retreieve agent versions via
the api and revert to a previous version via the api and the dashboard.

#### Token Refresh

Guests actively using their space will have their token's automatically renewed.

#### Sheet & Cell Updates

Support for array values in cell values has also been added.

#### Job Metadata

Metadta is now available on the `JobConfig` type, allowing additional data to be
associated with jobs.
</Update>

<Update label="09-06-2024" description="dashboard">
Session name validation has been introduced to the dashboard, preventing the
creation of new sessions with the same name.

![image](../changelog/images/spacename_validation.png)

Note that sessions created via embedded or the api will not be constrained, this
is a dashboard only validation.
</Update>

<Update label="08-20-2024" description="spaces-ui">
`@flatfile/api@1.9.13` `spaces-ui`

New fields 'guide' and 'guardrail' have been added to Actions. These options
enable providing markdown guidance and warnings to your users.

```typescript
actions: [
  {
    operation: 'submitActionFg',
    mode: 'foreground',
    label: 'Submit For Approval',
    type: 'string',
    description: 'Submit this data to a webhook.',
    primary: true,
    guide: {
        content: "### Personalized Guide \n\n Before performing..."
    },
    guardrail: {
        content: "### Warning! \n\n This Submit ..."
    }
  },
  {...}
],
```

The markdown content of guide will become accessible to the end user via a
tooltip on the action element.

The `guardrail` component will render as a modal warning before the action event
is triggered. This can be useful for actions that have critical consequences or
require user acknowledgment before proceeding.

This can be useful for actions that have critical consequences or require user
acknowledgment before proceeding.
</Update>

<Update label="08-15-2024" description="spaces-ui">
`spaces-ui`

The "requireAllValidTotal" option has been added for custom actions in the Sheet
toolbar. This new option requires all rows in the Sheet to be valid for the
action to be enabled, regardless of selection. If "requireAllValidTotal" is set
and there are any validation errors in the entire Sheet, the custom action will
be disabled with the corresponding tooltip message.

The existing "requireAllValid" option has been updated to only apply to the
selected rows, rather than all rows. If "requireAllValid" is set and there are
validation errors in the selected rows, the custom action will be disabled with
the corresponding tooltip message.
</Update>

`@flatfile/api@1.9.8`

A new `reference-list` property type has been added to allow defining an array
of values referenced from another sheet. Links will be established automatically
by the matching engine or similar upon an evaluation of unique or similar
columns between datasets.

The `ReferencePropertyConfig` has been updated to make the `relationship`
property optional, allowing it to be omitted.
</Update>

<Update label="07-23-2024" description="dataxp">
`@flatfile/api@1.9.7`

New options have been added to the ListWorkbooksRequest to allow filtering
workbooks by name, namespace, label, and treatment, as well as controlling
whether to include sheets. For example, you can now pass a `name` parameter to
filter workbooks by name, or a `treatment` parameter to filter by treatment. The
`includeSheets` boolean parameter controls whether sheet data is included in the
response.
</Update>

<Update label="07-17-2024" description="dataxp">
`@flatfile/api@1.9.6`

In AgentConfig type, a new optional property `sourceMap` of type string has been
added. This allows including a source map for the agent code.
</Update>

<Update label="07-16-2024" description="dataxp">
`@flatfile/api@1.9.5`

A new property `treatments` of type `Flatfile.WorkbookTreatments[]` has been
added to the `Workbook` and `CreateWorkbookConfig` types. This array allows
specifying treatments for a workbook, with the currently available treatment
being `ExtractedFromSource`. This change introduces a new external interface
that developers using the package should be aware of when creating or updating
workbooks.

Example usage:

```typescript
import { Flatfile } from "@flatfile/api";

const workbookConfig: Flatfile.CreateWorkbookConfig = {
  // ...other properties
  treatments: [Flatfile.WorkbookTreatments.ExtractedFromSource],
};
```
</Update>

<Update label="07-13-2024" description="dataxp">
`@flatfile/api@1.9.3`

A new `JobOutcomeTrigger` type has been introduced to specify whether a job
outcome's effect should be triggered automatically or manually.
</Update>

<Update label="06-18-2024" description="spaces">
**Auto-Expanding Cell Input in Editor Component**

We have enhanced the cell editing experience with an auto-expanding cell input
that dynamically adjusts to fit the content. This improvement ensures that users
can view and edit their data without constraints, enhancing the overall editing
experience.
</Update>

<Update label="06-10-2024" description="spaces-ui">
`spaces-ui`

Improvements have been made to error handling and user feedback in the file
import and mapping process. If an error occurs, a popover is displayed to the
user with the error message, providing clearer feedback on failures during the
import process.
</Update>

<Update label="06-07-2024" description="dataxp">
**Select Header Row**

We've added a new feature that allows users to select the header row in the data
preview. This feature is particularly useful when the first row of your data
contains column headers, as it enables you to specify the header row for
accurate data mapping.
</Update>

<Update label="06-07-2024" description="dataxp">
**Search for Users**

You can now search for users in the manager users page. This feature allows you
to quickly find users by name, email, or role, making it easier to manage your
user base.

![image](../changelog/images/search.gif)
</Update>

<Update label="06-06-2024" description="dataxp">
**Resend User Invite**

There is now a `/users/:userId/resend-invite` endpoint enabling admins to resend
an invitation to a user who has not yet accepted it.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" description="dataxp">
**Bulk Deletion of Mapping Rules**

We added a method to delete multiple mapping rules from a program. This new
`deleteMultipleRules` method simplifies the management of mapping rules by
allowing bulk deletions. The `DeleteMultipleRulesRequest` type represents the
request payload, detailing the array of rule IDs to be deleted.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" description="dataxp">
**New Method to Delete Apps**

We have introduced a new `delete` method that allows you to delete an app.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" description="spaces">
**Enhanced Validation Messages for Records**

The `ValidationMessage` type has been enhanced with two new optional properties:
`field` and `path`. The `field` property specifies which field the validation
message pertains to, while the `path` property, of type `JsonPathString`,
specifies the JSONPath for the validation message. These enhancements provide
more context and precision in validation feedback.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" description="dataxp">
**Enhanced Job Outcomes with Custom Views**

The `JobOutcomeNext` type now includes a new `view` option, allowing jobs to
specify a custom view that should be displayed upon completion. To support this,
we introduced the `JobOutcomeNextView` type, which provides details for the
custom view, including the sheet ID, hidden columns, and an optional label.
</Update>

<Update label="05-30-2024" description="dataxp">
**New Method to Update Sheets**

We introduced a new `updateSheet` method that allows you to update a sheet's
name, slug, and metadata. The `SheetUpdateRequest` type represents the update
request payload, including the name, slug, and metadata of the sheet.
Additionally, an optional `metadata` property has been added to the `Sheet` and
`SheetUpdate` types, allowing for the storage of contextual metadata related to
the sheet.
</Update>

<Update label="05-29-2024" description="spaces-ui">
`spaces-ui`

A new "Update View" button can now be found in the job outcome modal for jobs
that modify the visibility of columns in a workbook sheet. This button triggers
updating the column visibility based on the job outcome.

There are 2 new capabilities to the next property of Job Outcomes:

- `view` gives developers the ability to manipulate the Sheet's view on
  completion of a Job - Giving control over things like applying a filter or
  hiding a column
- `download` gives developers the ability to include file details (such as a
  fileName and URL), which are then used to trigger a download to the user's
  browser on completion of the job
</Update>

<Update label="05-14-2024" description="dataxp">
**New Environment Lifecycle Events**

We've added new domain `Environment` events expanding the scope of domains our
system recognizes. To leverage these events, you can listen on to the following
topics: The corresponding event topics are `environment:created`,
`environment:updated`, and `environment:deleted`.
</Update>

<Update label="05-14-2024" description="dataxp">
**Enhanced Job Configuration Descriptions**

We have added descriptions for the DeleteRecordsJobConfig properties to provide
better clarity: An optional `filter` param allows allows you to provide options
to filter records, with the default set to none while the `filterField` param
enables narrowing the valid/error filter results to a specific field, but it
requires the filter to be set.

We corrected a typo in the `JobOutcomeNextFiles` type by renaming the file
property to files to accurately represent an array of file objects.
</Update>

<Update label="05-07-2024" description="spaces-ui">
`spaces-ui`

#### Saving and Sharing Custom Views

Users can now apply filters, sorting, and search queries to the Sheet data and
save those settings as a reusable view. Key changes include:

- Added a "Views" dropdown in the Sheet toolbar to manage and apply saved views.
- Added a "Save View" modal that allows users to name and save the current Sheet
  filters/sorting as a view.
- Users can copy a sharable link with the view settings applied.
- Saved views are grouped into "My Views" and "All Views" sections.
- Added backend APIs to create, update, and delete saved views.
- Added new React hooks and components to support the saved views functionality.
- Updated translations for the new UI elements related to saved views.
</Update>

<Update label="05-03-2024" description="dataxp">
**Updated `ListDocumentsResponse`**

The `data` property now returns an array of `Document` objects instead of the
previous `DocumentResponse`. This change standardizes the format and improves
consistency in how document data is handled.
</Update>

<Update label="05-03-2024" description="dataxp">
**Enhanced Job Configuration**

We added a new `predecessorIds` property to `JobConfig`. This property allows
you to specify job dependencies, meaning you can list the IDs of jobs that must
be completed before the current job can start. This helps in managing and
sequencing job execution more effectively.

We added a new feature to handle job outcomes more effectively with a new type
called `JobOutcomeNext` and its variant files. This includes:

- `JobOutcomeNextFileObject` Stores individual file information with an ID and
  optional label.
- `JobOutcomeNextFiles` Handles multiple files, including an array of
  JobOutcomeNextFileObject instances and an optional label.

We also added a waiting value to the JobStatus enum to indicate when a job is
paused or pending, improving job processing workflows.
</Update>

<Update label="05-03-2024" description="spaces">
**Enhanced Views Request and Response**

We updated `ListViewsRequest` to include optional `pageSize` and `pageNumber`
properties, allowing for pagination when retrieving views. We've also added a
`createdBy` property to `View` and `ViewResponse` to track the creator of each
view.
</Update>

<Update label="05-01-2024" description="spaces">
**Improved event emission logic for workbook creation and update**

Previously, the `workbook:created` event was emitted even when the workbook was
only being updated. Now, the logic emits a `workbook:updated` event when
necessary. Additionally, the `POST /:workbookId/rebuild` endpoint now handles
eventing properly.
</Update>

<Update label="05-01-2024" description="spaces">
**Enhanced Date Parsing Capabilities**

**Expanded Support for Date Formats**:

We've broadened our parsing algorithms to accurately recognize and sort a wider
variety of date formats. This update ensures that when users upload files
containing date fields, the system robustly handles various international date
formats and styles.

**Improved Sorting Accuracy**:

Dates are now correctly sorted based on their actual chronological order,
regardless of the format input. This enhancement reduces errors and
inconsistencies previously encountered with date sorting, ensuring data
integrity and reliability during file uploads.

**User Experience Improvement**:

Users no longer need to modify or standardize date formats in their files before
uploading. Flatfile automatically interprets and processes diverse date inputs,
simplifying workflows and reducing manual data preprocessing.
</Update>

<Update label="04-25-2024" description="spaces">
**Sorted Workbooks in Mapping**

Selecting a Sheet in the mapping flow has been updated to apply the same sort
order consideration as the sidebar. This enhancement ensures consistency in
workbook sorting for improved user navigation.
</Update>

<Update label="04-23-2024" description="spaces">
**Origin info now exists in Files table**

Now, origin tracking is available for file uploads, supporting sources like
Google Drive, File System, Box, and OneDrive.
</Update>

<Update label="04-22-2024" description="spaces">
**Improved Duplicate Field Key Validation in Workbook Sheets**

**Case-Insensitive Checking**:

Our latest update enhances the validation process by identifying duplicate field
keys in workbook sheets, including case-insensitive comparisons. This ensures
that field keys are unique regardless of character casing, maintaining data
integrity and consistency across your datasets.

**Data Integrity Assurance**:

By preventing the entry of duplicate keys, even when differences are only in
letter casing, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of data processing within
our application.
</Update>

<Update label="04-22-2024" description="spaces">
When uploading a file, you'll now see upload speeds in a user-friendly format
(KB/s, MB/s, GB/s).
</Update>

<Update label="04-18-2024" description="spaces">
**Introducing customizable column sizes in the Flatfile Blueprint**

A new new sizing options has been added for string fields to enhance visual
customization and user interface consistency.

See the new
[property](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/workbooks/create#request.body.sheets.fields.string.appearance).
</Update>

<Update label="04-17-2024" description="spaces">
**Enhanced Workbook Build Process and Diagnostic Logging**

**Extended Wait Time for Workbook Readiness**:

To accommodate more complex data processing needs, we have extended the maximum
wait time for workbook readiness from 30 to 120 seconds. This adjustment ensures
that larger or more complex workbooks have sufficient time to complete their
build process without interruption.

**Added Timeout Functionality**:

We've introduced a new timeout feature that automatically stops the workbook
building process if it exceeds the allotted time. This prevents prolonged waits
and potential system overloads, improving overall system reliability.

**Improved Logging Capabilities**:

To aid in troubleshooting and optimize workbook build performance, we have
enhanced our logging system. Logs now include additional context information,
offering deeper insights into the workbook building process and helping identify
and resolve issues more efficiently.
</Update>

<Update label="04-12-2024" description="spaces">
**Enhanced Cell-Level Control in Records**

We've introduced a new configuration property that allows users to set
individual cells within a record to read-only. This enhancement extends our

**Enhanced Enum Mapping Logic for Datasets with No Values**

We’ve addressed a nuanced issue concerning enum mapping and rule application in
datasets with no values. Previously, the system saved enum mapping rules with a
logic in place to reuse these rules if every value in a new dataset matched the
rule. This approach inadvertently included scenarios where datasets had no
values, considering them as matching all rules due to the absence of values.

Now, the system filters and applies enum mapping rules based solely on the
values present in the new dataset. This change ensures that rules are applied
more accurately, enhancing the system’s logic in handling datasets, especially
those without any values. This update aims to provide a more reliable and
logical framework for data processing and rule application.

**Introducing the Flatfile Dedicated Mapping APIs**

We’re excited to announce the launch of the Flatfile Dedicated Mapping API, a
significant enhancement to our suite of tools. This new API, encapsulated within
a user-friendly Python library, is designed to fully harness Flatfile’s mapping
capabilities. It provides a robust solution for mapping schemas directly within
your systems, ensuring that your data remains secure in your database. This API
is ideal for a range of applications, from data pipelines and API integrations
to complex data conversion workflows.

The essence of mapping with this API is the transformation of source records
into target records. This process ranges from straightforward tasks like
renaming fields (for example, changing “first_name” to “firstName”) to more
complex operations such as extracting substrings from fields or concatenating
multiple fields.

Our Mapping API and accompanying Python library bring forth new opportunities
for efficient and precise data mapping, offering customization to meet your
unique needs and workflow requirements.

**Enhanced Theming options for Filters**

![image](../changelog/images/theming_chips.png)

We've expanded the theming capabilities for filters, providing a more
customizable and visually appealing interface:

**Usage**

```jsx
"theme": {
    "table": {
      "filters": {
        "outerBorder": "2px red solid",
        "innerBorderRadius": "0px",
        "outerBorderRadius": "0px"
      }
  }
}
```

1. New Styling Features for Filters: We've introduced the option to customize
   filters with borders and border radius as part of the table theme.

2. Flexible Border Radius Design: To accommodate the varying sizes of elements
   and the potential difference in calculated border radius, we now use both
   inner and outer border radius settings. This enhancement not only ensures a
   cohesive look but also adds an extra layer of styling flexibility to the
   filters.

These improvements are designed to offer more control over the aesthetics of
filters, enabling a seamless and integrated visual experience.

**Improved Handling of Long-Running Jobs with New Timeout Feature**

![image](../changelog/images/job_failure.png)

To enhance clarity and efficiency in job processing, we’ve implemented an update
for managing long-running jobs. Previously, jobs that weren’t acknowledged
within 5 minutes would silently fail due to a timeout by the agent, leading to
confusion as these jobs never reached completion (They were left in an executing
state).

To address this, we’ve now added a routine check that occurs every 5 minutes.
This check will automatically fail jobs that are still executing but haven’t
been
[acknowledged](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/jobs/acknowledge-a-job)

guest. Now, if you know the `guestId`, interactions in Flatfile can be tied back
to that person.

This is made possible with a new endpoint, **/guests/:guestId/token**, which
generates an accessToken, and can be used to load the Flatfile space at
**http://platform.flatfile.com/space/:spaceId?token=:accessToken**.

With this method, Guests are now accurately named and identifiable, enhancing

**Disable Actions while Hooks are Running**

![image](../changelog/images/trackChanges.gif)

Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all hooks had

preventing unintended data egress. As a workaround, they resorted to creating
placeholder fields that defaulted to invalid states. When a hook completed
processing for a record, it marked the field as valid, allowing submission only
when there were no errors in this field.

Now, we're thrilled to introduce a solution to simplify this process—an all-new
event: `commit:completed`. This event signals the end of all processing tasks.

```jsx

Here’s how it works:

- When you set allowAdditionalFields to true, your Sheet gains the ability to
  accept additional fields, extending beyond what’s originally specified in its
  configuration.
- These extra fields can be incorporated, either through API integrations or by
  end users during the file import process.
- Fields that go beyond the Blueprint’s initial setup are marked with a
  treatment property set to additional, ensuring complete transparency over what
  extends the Blueprint.
- What’s more, adding a custom field is a breeze—its name will be automatically

**New: Promote Sheet Actions**

![image](../changelog/images/primary_actions.png)

Previously, the `primary:true` concept on Actions didn't affect Sheet actions,
leaving them all in the "more actions" drop-down. But now, setting primary to
true will showcase these actions right in the Sheet toolbar, as buttons with
clear, user-friendly text.
</Update>

<Update label="09-20-2023" description="dataxp">
You can now effortlessly view up to 500k records at once. When you reach the end
of the table, a helpful message will appear, reminding you that there's more
data waiting. Simply search or filter to reduce the size of your dataset and
access it all. This change was added due to browser limitations that restrict
maximum height in the DOM.

proper handling when upserting a secret into an Environment after specifying a
Space ID.
</Update>

<Update label="09-13-2023" description="files">
Resolved an issue where the import button could prematurely appear before a file
was ready to be imported. This was due to an early update of the file's status
with a workbook ID, which has now been adjusted to wait until the data is
queriable before updating. The import process now aligns better with the file's
readiness.

<Update label="09-06-2023" description="dataxp">
**New Job Outcome Acknowledgements**

**`acknowledge: false`**

![image](../changelog/images/outcome_modal.png)

By default, job outcomes are reported through a toast notification in the
top-right corner. To utilize this, simply set `outcome => message`. This
approach ensures that your job completion status is promptly communicated to the
end user.

**`acknowledge: true`**

![image](../changelog/images/outcome_fullscreen.png)

When the `acknowledge` option is configured as `true`, a persistent full-screen
modal is presented. This modal remains visible until the user interacts by
clicking the "Continue" button, acknowledging the outcome.

**Usage**

```jsx
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    acknowlege: true,
    message: "Text here.",
  },
});
```

This enhancement provides flexibility in how you choose to inform users about
job outcomes. [Learn more](../guides/actions#usage).
</Update>

<Update label="09-06-2023" description="dataxp">
**Enhanced Job Outcomes with Next Action Links**

Job outcomes have been upgraded to support `next` action links. Now, you can
display links to external URLs, trigger downloads, or retry jobes upon job
completion/failure.

**Usage**

```jsx listener
await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
  outcome: {
    next: Url | Download | Retry,
    message: "Text here.",
  },
});
```

This improvement adds versatility and flexibility to your job outcomes,
enhancing user interaction and experience.

</Update>

<Update label="09-06-2023" description="dataxp">
**Enhanced Action Button Behavior**

![image](../changelog/images/hasAllValid.gif)

Two key enhancements to Actions have been introduced:

**Disable Actions When Invalid Records**: Developers can now add an optional
flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or
Workbooks contain invalid records. This helps avoid unnecessary job failures and
ensures Actions are performed on valid data.

```jsx
constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }],
```

**Disable Actions When No Selected Records:** To enhance the user experience,
we've introduced the `hasSelection` flag. When added as a constraint, this flag
disables Actions if no records are selected in the Sheet or Workbook, ensuring
Actions are only triggered when relevant data is chosen.

```jsx
constraints: [ { type: 'hasSelection' }],
```

[Learn more](../orchestration/actions#optional-parameters).
</Update>

<Update label="09-01-2023" description="dataxp">
**Improved FFQL handling of dates and number comparisons**

**Enhanced Number Field Queries:**

When conducting equality or inequality FFQL comparisons for `number` fields, the
query value is now cast to a number and then compared with the parsed "shadow"
value. This rectifies issues related to numeric comparisons. Additionally, we've
resolved a bug where numbers with no digits before the decimal point (e.g.,
".3") were not being properly parsed into shadow values.

**Advanced Date Field Handling:**

For `date` fields, query values are now attempted to be parsed into dates. On
the SQL side, a `CASE` statement is employed to parse the stored values into
dates for accurate comparison. To accommodate SQL-side date parsing
requirements, we've integrated a regex pattern to detect `YYYY-MM-DD`, `m/d/yy`,
and `m/d/yyyy` formats. This ensures correct parsing and comparison of date
values.

**Fix for Invalid Number Input:**

We've resolved a bug where changing a number field to an invalid number left the
previous "shadow" value intact. Now, in such cases, the previous shadow value is
properly cleared, leading to consistent and accurate behavior.

These updates contribute to improved query handling, better data integrity, and
a more seamless experience when working with number and date fields.

<Update label="09-01-2023" description="core">
Introducing caching for record counts, resulting in improved performance for API
requests.

capability empowers users with more flexible and efficient options when updating
Sheets.
</Update>

<Update label="09-01-2023" description="dataxp">
# ![image](../changelog/images/tooltips-actions.png)

We've introduced a new parameter: `tooltip` to Actions, allowing the addition of
tooltips. These tooltips are now visible in the user interface for both buttons
and list items whenever the associated Action is enabled. This enhancement
provides users with clear and context-aware explanations for enabled Actions,
contributing to an improved overall user experience.
</Update>

<Update label="09-01-2023" description="dataxp">
Fixed a cosmetic issue with scrolling through Workbooks. The problem stemmed
from the outer container scrolling based on the inner content's height. By
applying overflow properties to the inner component, which holds a list of items
within a flex container, we have resolved this issue.

The API specification has been updated to facilitate the mapping of `enum`
values of various types such as `string`, `integer`, or `boolean`. This
modification effectively resolves a server error response that was previously
encountered when utilizing such `enum` values within the API.

In addition, the loading state of the "Continue" button has been refined to
ensure smooth recovery from server errors. This adjustment enhances the overall
user experience by providing more graceful handling of unexpected issues during
the process.
</Update>

<Update label="08-25-2023" description="spaces">
**🚀 Instant Extraction for CSV/TSV/PSV Files**

With the removal of the extraction step for CSV/TSV/PSV files, the import
experience is now more seamless than ever. As soon as the upload is complete,
these files are instantly extracted, ensuring an efficient and immediate
handling of your data.

The impact of this change is remarkable. What used to take approximately 3 and a
half minutes to extract now concludes in less than 10 seconds.

In addition, we now natively support TSV and PSV files meaning you don't need to
use an extractor plugin to support these file types.

While speed is the prime advantage, this upgrade doesn’t merely boost
performance. It also simplifies and enhances reliability in our system.
Previously, concerns about only a fraction of a file being extracted are now
history. Furthermore, this approach strategically eases the load on our
database, reducing the likelihood of encountering resource limits.

In essence, it’s a win-win for both efficiency and user experience.
