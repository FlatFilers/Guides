      **🚀 4 New Example Spaces**

      Visit the **Getting Started** page on your Dashboard to discover four new options for effortlessly generating demo spaces:
      1. Namespaces
      2. Metadata
      3. Egress
      4. Sidebar Customization

Similar to the rest of the options, we've provided the underlying code for each Space, simplifying the process of breaking down and comprehending the elements on display.

      **Authentication Query Enhancement**

      The authentication query has been streamlined for optimized performance. Extensive benchmarking has revealed that this refinement contributes to a reduction of approximately 20 milliseconds for each request. This enhancement results in faster overall processing and improved response times.

      A pagination logic issue concerning **Environments** has been resolved. The correction ensures accurate calculation of the number of pages and consistent delivery of valid responses in accordance with the [Pagination](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/1dcb99aada63f-pagination) type.

Furthermore, the default page size for **Spaces** has been set to 10, aligning it with the specifications outlined in the API documentation.

      A custom button has been integrated into searchable dropdowns. This addition prevents filtering of results upon clicking the standard input. From now on, result filtering will exclusively occur in response to clicking the button only.

      The API specification has been updated to facilitate the mapping of `enum` values of various types such as `string`, `integer`, or `boolean`. This modification effectively resolves a server error response that was previously encountered when utilizing such `enum` values within the API.

      In addition, the loading state of the "Continue" button has been refined to ensure smooth recovery from server errors. This adjustment enhances the overall user experience by providing more graceful handling of unexpected issues during the process.

      In the recent change for instant extraction, we noticed header detection involved parsing the entire file, which posed challenges for large files. Now, we've limited this process to the first N lines.

      **🚀 Instant Extraction for CSV/TSV/PSV Files**

      We’re thrilled to introduce a significant enhancement to our import process. With the removal of the extraction step for CSV/TSV/PSV files, the import experience is now more seamless than ever. As soon as the upload is complete, these files are instantly extracted, ensuring an efficient and immediate handling of your data.

      The impact of this change is remarkable. What used to take approximately 3 and a half minutes to extract now concludes in less than 10 seconds.

      In addition, we now natively support TSV and PSV files meaning you don't need to use an extractor plugin to support these file types.

      While speed is the prime advantage, this upgrade doesn’t merely boost performance. It also simplifies and enhances reliability in our system. Previously, concerns about only a fraction of a file being extracted are now history. Furthermore, this approach strategically eases the load on our database, reducing the likelihood of encountering resource limits.

      In essence, it’s a win-win for both efficiency and user experience.
