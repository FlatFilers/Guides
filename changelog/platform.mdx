        **Disable Actions while Hooks are Running**

        ![image](../changelog/images/commit_completed.png)

        Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all hooks had finished running, essential for ensuring data transformation completion and preventing unintended data egress. As a workaround, they resorted to creating placeholder fields that defaulted to invalid states. When a hook completed processing for a record, it marked the field as valid, allowing submission only when there were no errors in this field.

        Now, we're thrilled to introduce a solution to simplify this process—an all-new event: `commit:completed`. This event signals the end of all processing tasks.

        Add a `settings` parameter in your sheet that includes `trackChanges: true,` to disable actions on both Sheets and Workbooks until any pending commits have been completed.

        }}

        **New Job Mode: `toolbar-blocking`**

        We're excited to introduce a third job mode called `toolbarBlocking` alongside the existing `foreground` and `background` modes. With this new mode, `toolbarBlocking`, you have the flexibility to disable the Sheet Toolbar and Column Header Menus while still allowing users to enter records manually.

        **Improved copy-paste experience while bulk selecting cells** 
        
        We've enhanced the bulk selection experience by enabling paste functionality. When you paste, we simply transition you out of the selection state, similar to when editing. Note: if you paste without selecting any cells, the operation will automatically apply to the bulk-selected rows.

        **New: Embed Sheets inside Documents**

        Now, by simply incorporating the `embed` HTML entity into your markdown body and providing the sheet ID, workbook ID, and name, you can effortlessly embed Sheets into Documents. Additionally, you have the flexibility to choose whether the embedded Sheet starts in an expanded or collapsed state when the document is loaded.

        ```html
        <embed
          type="embedded-sheet"
          name="Contacts"
          defaultExpanded="true"
          sheetId="your_sheet_id"
          workbookId="your_workbook_id"
        />
        ```

        This enhancement provides further freedom to tailor document-driven interactions precisely to your needs.

        **Actions are now available on Documents.**

        ![image](../changelog/images/document_actions_primary.png)

       Documents, which are standalone webpages within your Spaces, can now host a variety of actions, just like Workbooks, Sheets, and Files.

        Document-Mounted Actions have their own configuration within a Document object. The executable code within an Action is compiled into a Job entity, offering the flexibility to run asynchronously or immediately. This empowers you to create more interactive and dynamic Documents, enhancing the overall user experience within your Flatfile Spaces.

        ```jsx workbook.js
        //your document can now have an action that looks like this
        actions: [
          {
            operation: 'sendAction',
            mode: 'foreground',
            label: 'Send to...',
            description: 'Send this page to someone.',
            primary: true,
          },
          {...}
        ]
        ```

        **The API now supports two new actions: `sheets.lock` and `sheets.unlock`.**

        With the introduction of these API actions, you gain the ability to manage sheet locking within your application. The `sheets.lock` action allows you to lock a sheet, preventing any further modifications to its content. Conversely, the `sheets.unlock` action enables you to release the lock and restore full editing capabilities to the sheet.

        These new API actions provide greater control and flexibility when it comes to managing sheet access and data integrity.

      >
        **New: Full-screen Documents!**

        Documents have gained a new capability, allowing them to seamlessly transition into full-screen takeovers, thus removing their presence from the sidebar.

        **How it works:**

        To enable this functionality, we've introduced a new property on Documents: `treatments`. This property allows users to define specific descriptors for each Document. When a Document is assigned the "ephemeral" treatment, it will transform into a full-screen overlay, visible exclusively within the Spaces dashboard, while being discreetly tucked away from the Spaces sidebar.

        This enhancement enhances user creativity and provides the freedom to tailor document-driven interactions precisely to their needs.

        ```ts
        await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
          treatments: ['ephemeral'],
          title: "Getting Started"
        });
        ```
    </div>

        **We’ve added Indonesia (ID) translations!**

       **Now Available: Set estimated time of completion on Jobs**

        ![image](../changelog/images/estimatedTime_actions.png)

         When acknowledging a job from a Workbook or Sheet action, you now have the option to set the `estimatedCompletionAt` parameter. Setting the estimated time of completion for the job leads to more informative and interactive features in the UI.
         1. In the Foreground Job overlay, you'll see real-time progress displayed as a percentage, along with an estimate of the remaining time.

         2. Additionally, the Jobs Panel will share visibility into the estimated remaining time for acknowledged jobs.

        }}
      >

         Previously, when uploading a file, actions could only be added to it after the file was uploaded (by calling a file update via a listener). Now, with our latest update, you can now include actions during file upload allowing actions to be applied to the file immediately upon creation.

        The find/replace operation is now able to handle large datasets. Now, records are batched into groups of 10,000 rows, and a unique versionId is assigned to each batch. Additionally, the workbook service will emit events for each batch processed.

        This improvement is particularly beneficial for @flatfile/plugin-record-hook, which can now retrieve and respond to all records in a single find/replace operation, thanks to the 10,000-row batching.

        When adding a secret to a space via the API, we have expanded the flexibility of secret names. While the API allows spaces within secret names, the UI previously restricted them by filtering spaces in the regex validation logic for Secret Names. With this update, space characters are now considered valid and accepted characters in secret names, aligning the behavior between the API and the UI.

         **Now Available: Accept Dynamic Inputs on Actions**

        ![image](../changelog/images/action_inputs.png)

        Now, when initiating an action, you have the option to gather additional information from end users to facilitate the successful completion of the intended task.

        **Here’s how it works:**

        Suppose you want to allow users to specify the name of the file they intend to export. In such cases, you can configure input fields for your action. When an end user triggers this action, a secondary dialog will appear, prompting them to provide the necessary information.

        **The available input types include:**

        - `string`: For capturing text-based information.
        - `textarea`: Ideal for longer text entries or descriptions.
        - `number`: To collect numeric data.
        - `boolean`: For simple yes/no or true/false responses.
        - `enum`: Enables users to select from a predefined list of options.

        **Two easy ways to get started:**

        - Learn about all the parameters available on `inputForm` for Actions [here](http://flatfile.com/docs/concepts/actions#inputform).

        **Exciting Update: Additional Fields**

        ![image](../changelog/images/addl_fields.png)

        With additional fields, end users can seamlessly map to fields that don’t exist by simply adding a new property to any of your new or pre-existing Blueprint(s).

        Here’s how it works:
        - When you set allowAdditionalFields to true, your Sheet gains the ability to accept additional fields, extending beyond what’s originally specified in its configuration.
        - These extra fields can be incorporated, either through API integrations or by end users during the file import process.
        - Fields that go beyond the Blueprint’s initial setup are marked with a treatment property set to additional, ensuring complete transparency over what extends the Blueprint.
        - What’s more, adding a custom field is a breeze—its name will be automatically set to match the header name from the file being mapped. This simplifies the process.

        **Introducing New and Enhanced Event Logs**

        ![image](../changelog/images/event_logs.png)

        Our aim is to make it easy for everyone to monitor events, find problems, and help developers avoid overcomplicating their code with excessive Console logs that would need removal later.

        With our enhanced Event logs, you can now:

        1. View a comprehensive list of logged events, categorized by event topic.
        2. Easily discern the status of each event.
        3. Gauge the execution time of each event.
        4. Access events chronologically, with the most recent at the top.
        5. Dive into each event for context and review any associated console logs.

        As an added bonus, you have the capability to filter events, focusing solely on failures.

        }}
      >

       Choosing a `namespace` on Space creation is now easier than ever. Rather than manually typing the namespaces into a free-form text field, you can simply choose from a dropdown menu of available options. The available namespaces are conveniently listed within the `namespaces` array of the Environment, providing a more efficient and accurate way to handle namespace selection.

        Previously, when using the find and replace feature, only the initial batch of records had data hooks run again. Now, the find/replace operation efficiently groups records into batches of 10,000 rows, assigning a unique versionId to each batch. This improvement empowers record-hooks to process all records seamlessly within a single find/replace operation.

        Previously, when adding a secret to a space through the API, we supported spaces in secret names. However, the UI had regex logic that filtered out spaces when validating secret names.

        In this update, we've harmonized the process by accepting space characters as valid characters for secret names in both the API and the UI. Your secret names can now include spaces without any issues.

      >

        We've resolved an issue where long messages would overflow the cell in validation messages. By implementing a straightforward `word-break` property, your validation messages will now display lengthy messages more elegantly.

In the past, when you attempted to replace specific characters with an empty string (""), it occasionally resulted in the cell value becoming null, which wasn't quite what you had in mind.

        For instance, if you needed to eliminate dashes from UUID fields, you'd naturally want "abc-123" to transform into "abc123" rather than mysteriously turning null.

        We value your feedback. Now, you can confidently perform partial replacements without the hassle of unexpected null values.

        We've made improvements behind the scenes to ensure that your data gets mapped with more precision. Previously, some data could be missed during mapping, but now, we're considering both the option labels and values, making sure nothing is left behind. This means you'll have a smoother and more reliable experience when mapping your data, ensuring that everything is captured correctly.

      **New Job Outcome Acknowledgements**

      **`acknowledge: false`**

      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_modal.png)

      By default, job outcomes are reported through a toast notification in the top-right corner. To utilize this, simply set `outcome => message`. This approach ensures that your job completion status is promptly communicated to the end user.

      **`acknowledge: true`**

      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_fullscreen.png)

      When the `acknowledge` option is configured as `true`, a persistent full-screen modal is presented. This modal remains visible until the user interacts by clicking the "Continue" button, acknowledging the outcome.

      **Usage**

      ```jsx
      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          acknowlege: true,
          message:
            "Text here.",
        },
      });
      ```

        **Enhanced Job Outcomes with Next Action Links**

      Job outcomes have been upgraded to support `next` action links. Now, you can display links to external URLs, Flatfile resources, or trigger downloads upon job completion.

      **Usage**
        <CodeGroup>
        ```jsx listener
        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            next: IdNext | WaitNext | UrlNext | DownloadNext,
            message:
              "Text here.",
          },
        });
        ```
        ```jsx Types
        type IdNext = {
          type: 'id' //link to a Flatfile resource
          id: string
        }

        type WaitNext = {
          type: 'wait' //only used in embedded Flatfile
        }

        type UrlNext = {
          type: 'url' //display a link to an external url
          url: string
          label: string
        }

        type DownloadNext = {
          type: 'download' // display and trigger a download
          url: string
          fileName: string
          label: string
        }

        **Enhanced Action Button Behavior**

        ![image](../changelog/images/disabled_actions.png)

       Two key enhancements to Actions have been introduced:

        **Disable Actions When Invalid Records**: Developers can now add an optional `constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }],` flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records. This helps avoid unnecessary job failures and ensures Actions are performed on valid data.

        **Disable Actions When No Selected Records:** To enhance the user experience, we've introduced the `constraints: [ { type: 'hasSelection' }],` flag. When added as a constraint, this flag disables Actions if no records are selected in the Sheet or Workbook, ensuring Actions are only triggered when relevant data is chosen.

    **Improved FFQL handling of dates and number comparisons**

      **Enhanced Number Field Queries:** When conducting equality or inequality FFQL comparisons for `number` fields, the query value is now cast to a number and then compared with the parsed "shadow" value. This rectifies issues related to numeric comparisons. Additionally, we've resolved a bug where numbers with no digits before the decimal point (e.g., ".3") were not being properly parsed into shadow values.

      **Advanced Date Field Handling:** For `date` fields, query values are now attempted to be parsed into dates. On the SQL side, a `CASE` statement is employed to parse the stored values into dates for accurate comparison. To accommodate SQL-side date parsing requirements, we've integrated a regex pattern to detect `YYYY-MM-DD`, `m/d/yy`, and `m/d/yyyy` formats. This ensures correct parsing and comparison of date values.

      **Fix for Invalid Number Input:** We've resolved a bug where changing a number field to an invalid number left the previous "shadow" value intact. Now, in such cases, the previous shadow value is properly cleared, leading to consistent and accurate behavior.

      These updates contribute to improved query handling, better data integrity, and a more seamless experience when working with number and date fields.

      The API specification has been updated to facilitate the mapping of `enum` values of various types such as `string`, `integer`, or `boolean`. This modification effectively resolves a server error response that was previously encountered when utilizing such `enum` values within the API.

      In addition, the loading state of the "Continue" button has been refined to ensure smooth recovery from server errors. This adjustment enhances the overall user experience by providing more graceful handling of unexpected issues during the process.

      **🚀 Instant Extraction for CSV/TSV/PSV Files**

      We’re thrilled to introduce a significant enhancement to our import process. With the removal of the extraction step for CSV/TSV/PSV files, the import experience is now more seamless than ever. As soon as the upload is complete, these files are instantly extracted, ensuring an efficient and immediate handling of your data.

      The impact of this change is remarkable. What used to take approximately 3 and a half minutes to extract now concludes in less than 10 seconds.

      In addition, we now natively support TSV and PSV files meaning you don't need to use an extractor plugin to support these file types.

      While speed is the prime advantage, this upgrade doesn’t merely boost performance. It also simplifies and enhances reliability in our system. Previously, concerns about only a fraction of a file being extracted are now history. Furthermore, this approach strategically eases the load on our database, reducing the likelihood of encountering resource limits.

      In essence, it’s a win-win for both efficiency and user experience.
