## October 2024

### October 28, 2024

<div style={{ display: "table", width: "auto" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "table-row", width: "auto" }}>
    <Snippet file="chips/dataxp.mdx" />
    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      **Bug Fixes in Edit and Create App Forms**
            
      We've resolved several issues affecting the Edit and Create App forms:
       - Fixed form validation issues
       - Improved error handling
       - Enhanced user feedback
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### October 17, 2024

<div style={{ display: "table", width: "auto" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "table-row", width: "auto" }}>
    <Snippet file="chips/dataxp.mdx" />
    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      Updated the AutoBuild flow to allow editing the working space name during the build process. The name can now be edited by clicking an icon next to the space name, which reveals an input field to enter a new name. The name change is saved when the input field loses focus or the Enter key is pressed. Added a badge indicating "Dev Mode" when not in the production environment.
      
      Simplified the loading step by removing the detailed progress indicators and showing only a centered loader component.
      
      Updated the BlueprintTab component to display a bottom border and align the blueprint view action icons to the right.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### October 03, 2024

<div style={{ display: "table", width: "auto" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "table-row", width: "auto" }}>
    <Snippet file="chips/spaces.mdx" />
    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      Implemented sheet ordering functionality in the sidebar. Sheets are now displayed in the order specified by the `sheetSidebarOrder` setting in the workbook. Any sheets not included in the order are appended to the end. 
      
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### October 01, 2024

<div style={{ display: "table", width: "auto" }}>
  <div style={{ display: "table-row", width: "auto" }}>
    <Snippet file="chips/dataxp.mdx" />
    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      The getDataDiff function has been updated to handle array values correctly when comparing proposed changes with existing source (src) and artifact data.
      
      If the proposed array value is the same as the existing array value in either the source or artifacts, it will not be included in the changeset returned by getDataDiff.
      
      The function now uses the lodash isEqual utility to compare array values, instead of strict equality (===), to account for differences in order or reference of array elements.
      
      For example, if the proposed tags array is ['jedi', 'sith'], it will not be included in the changeset if the existing source tags are ['JEDI', 'SITH'] or if the existing artifact tags are ['jedi', 'sith'], because the values are considered equal despite differences in capitalization or array order.
      
      This change ensures that unnecessary changes are not included in the changeset when working with array values, reducing noise and improving the accuracy of the changeset calculation.

      `@flatfile/api@1.9.13` `spaces-ui`
      
      New fields 'guide' and 'guardrail' have been added to Actions. These options enable providing markdown guidance and warnings to your users.
      
      ```typescript
      actions: [
        {
          operation: 'submitActionFg',
          mode: 'foreground',
          label: 'Submit For Approval',
          type: 'string',
          description: 'Submit this data to a webhook.',
          primary: true,
          guide: {
              content: "### Personalized Guide \n\n Before performing..."
          },
          guardrail: {
              content: "### Warning! \n\n This Submit ..."
          }
        },
        {...}
      ],
      ```
      
      The markdown content of guide will become accessible to the end user via a tooltip on the action element.
      
      The `guardrail` component will render as a modal warning before the action event is triggered. This can be useful for actions that have critical consequences or require user acknowledgment before proceeding.

      `spaces-ui`
      
      The "requireAllValidTotal" option has been added for custom actions in the Sheet toolbar.
      This new option requires all rows in the Sheet to be valid for the action to be enabled, regardless of selection. 
      If "requireAllValidTotal" is set and there are any validation errors in the entire Sheet, the custom action will be disabled with the corresponding tooltip message. 
      
      The existing "requireAllValid" option has been updated to only apply to the selected rows, rather than all rows. 
      If "requireAllValid" is set and there are validation errors in the selected rows, the custom action will be disabled with the corresponding tooltip message.

      A new property `treatments` of type `Flatfile.WorkbookTreatments[]` has been added to the `Workbook` and `CreateWorkbookConfig` types.
      This array allows specifying treatments for a workbook, with the currently available treatment being `ExtractedFromSource`.
      This change introduces a new external interface that developers using the package should be aware of when creating or updating workbooks.
      
      Example usage:
      
      ```typescript
      import { Flatfile } from '@flatfile/api';
      
      const workbookConfig: Flatfile.CreateWorkbookConfig = {
        // ...other properties

      **Select Header Row**
      
      We've added a new feature that allows users to select the header row in the data preview. This feature is particularly useful when the first row of your data contains column headers, as it enables you to specify the header row for accurate data mapping.

      **New Method to Update Sheets**
      
      We introduced a new `updateSheet` method that allows you to update a sheet's name, slug, and metadata. The `SheetUpdateRequest` type represents the update request payload, including the name, slug, and metadata of the sheet. Additionally, an optional `metadata` property has been added to the `Sheet` and `SheetUpdate` types, allowing for the storage of contextual metadata related to the sheet.

      `spaces-ui`
      
      A new "Update View" button can now be found in the job outcome modal for jobs that modify the visibility of columns in a workbook sheet. This button triggers updating the column visibility based on the job outcome.
      
      There are 2 new capabilities to the next property of Job Outcomes:
      
      - `view` gives developers the ability to manipulate the Sheet's view on completion of a Job - Giving control over things like applying a filter or hiding a column
      - `download` gives developers the ability to include file details (such as a fileName and URL), which are then used to trigger a download to the user's browser on completion of the job

      **New Environment Lifecycle Events**
      
      We've added new domain `Environment` events expanding the scope of domains our system recognizes. To leverage these events, you can listen on to the following topics:
      The corresponding event topics are `environment:created`, `environment:updated`, and `environment:deleted`.

      **Enhanced Job Configuration Descriptions**
      
      We have added descriptions for the DeleteRecordsJobConfig properties to provide better clarity:
      An optional `filter` param allows allows you to provide options to filter records, with the default set to none while the `filterField` param enables narrowing the valid/error filter results to a specific field, but it requires the filter to be set.
      
      We corrected a typo in the `JobOutcomeNextFiles` type by renaming the file property to files to accurately represent an array of file objects.

      ###### Saving and Sharing Custom Views
      
      Users can now apply filters, sorting, and search queries to the Sheet data and save those settings as a reusable view. Key changes include:
      
      - Added a "Views" dropdown in the Sheet toolbar to manage and apply saved views.
      - Added a "Save View" modal that allows users to name and save the current Sheet filters/sorting as a view.
      - Users can copy a sharable link with the view settings applied.
      - Saved views are grouped into "My Views" and "All Views" sections.
      - Added backend APIs to create, update, and delete saved views.
      - Added new React hooks and components to support the saved views functionality.
      - Updated translations for the new UI elements related to saved views.

      **Enhanced Job Configuration**
      
      We added a new `predecessorIds` property to `JobConfig`. This property allows you to specify job dependencies, meaning you can list the IDs of jobs that must be completed before the current job can start. This helps in managing and sequencing job execution more effectively.
      
      We added a new feature to handle job outcomes more effectively with a new type called `JobOutcomeNext` and its variant files. This includes:
      
      - `JobOutcomeNextFileObject` Stores individual file information with an ID and optional label.
      - `JobOutcomeNextFiles` Handles multiple files, including an array of JobOutcomeNextFileObject instances and an optional label.
      
      We also added a waiting value to the JobStatus enum to indicate when a job is paused or pending, improving job processing workflows.

      **Enhanced Date Parsing Capabilities**
      
      **Expanded Support for Date Formats**:
      
      We've broadened our parsing algorithms to accurately recognize and sort a wider variety of date formats. This update ensures that when users upload files containing date fields, the system robustly handles various international date formats and styles.
      
      **Improved Sorting Accuracy**:
      
      Dates are now correctly sorted based on their actual chronological order, regardless of the format input. This enhancement reduces errors and inconsistencies previously encountered with date sorting, ensuring data integrity and reliability during file uploads.
      
      **User Experience Improvement**:
      
      Users no longer need to modify or standardize date formats in their files before uploading. Flatfile automatically interprets and processes diverse date inputs, simplifying workflows and reducing manual data preprocessing.

      **Improved Duplicate Field Key Validation in Workbook Sheets**
      
      **Case-Insensitive Checking**:
      
      Our latest update enhances the validation process by identifying duplicate field keys in workbook sheets, including case-insensitive comparisons. This ensures that field keys are unique regardless of character casing, maintaining data integrity and consistency across your datasets.
      
      **Data Integrity Assurance**:
      
      By preventing the entry of duplicate keys, even when differences are only in letter casing, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of data processing within our application.

      **Enhanced Workbook Build Process and Diagnostic Logging**
      
      **Extended Wait Time for Workbook Readiness**:
      
      To accommodate more complex data processing needs, we have extended the maximum wait time for workbook readiness from 30 to 120 seconds. This adjustment ensures that larger or more complex workbooks have sufficient time to complete their build process without interruption.
      
      **Added Timeout Functionality**:
      
      We've introduced a new timeout feature that automatically stops the workbook building process if it exceeds the allotted time. This prevents prolonged waits and potential system overloads, improving overall system reliability.
      
      **Improved Logging Capabilities**:
      
      To aid in troubleshooting and optimize workbook build performance, we have enhanced our logging system. Logs now include additional context information, offering deeper insights into the workbook building process and helping identify and resolve issues more efficiently.

      **Refined AI Mapping Precision**
      
      We’ve fine-tuned the interplay between AI-generated mapping suggestions and user-defined mapping history to enhance accuracy and user trust in our system. Previously, AI recommendations marked as “very confident” could override mappings with a user history score greater than 0.99. To address this, we’ve now implemented a cap on AI mapping scores, ensuring they do not exceed 0.99. This change guarantees that high-confidence user history takes precedence, fostering a more reliable and user-centric mapping experience.

      **Enhanced Enum Mapping Logic for Datasets with No Values**
      
      We’ve addressed a nuanced issue concerning enum mapping and rule application in datasets with no values. Previously, the system saved enum mapping rules with a logic in place to reuse these rules if every value in a new dataset matched the rule. This approach inadvertently included scenarios where datasets had no values, considering them as matching all rules due to the absence of values.
      
      Now, the system filters and applies enum mapping rules based solely on the values present in the new dataset. This change ensures that rules are applied more accurately, enhancing the system’s logic in handling datasets, especially those without any values. This update aims to provide a more reliable and logical framework for data processing and rule application.

      **Optimized Space Loading Series: Reduced Requests for Translations**
      
      We've streamlined the loading process for Spaces by eliminating an unnecessary request for translations that previously triggered an additional getSpaceById call. This refinement reduces the load time, ensuring Spaces are displayed more promptly for a smoother user experience.

      **New: Advanced Column Filtering Feature**
      
      Beyond the existing functionalities of sorting, replacing empty values, and conducting searches within fields, we’ve now integrated a precise value filtering option for columns. This new feature includes a convenient search mechanism to effortlessly pinpoint and filter by the specific value you’re seeking. Streamline your data analysis and management with this robust filtering capability.

      **Enhanced Data Mapping Consistency with user created custom fields**
      
      In our continuous efforts to streamline data import processes, we've implemented an improvement targeting the scenario where mapping rules from previous imports include destination fields no longer present in the current schema. This situation can arise if a custom field was added during a past import session and the data being imported is from a completely new sheet, often observed in embedded imports. With this update, we ensure a smoother data mapping experience by automatically filtering out rules that do not match the current destination blueprint, maintaining consistency and accuracy in your data integration efforts.

      **Introducing the Flatfile Dedicated Mapping APIs**
      
      We’re excited to announce the launch of the Flatfile Dedicated Mapping API, a significant enhancement to our suite of tools. This new API, encapsulated within a user-friendly Python library, is designed to fully harness Flatfile’s mapping capabilities. It provides a robust solution for mapping schemas directly within your systems, ensuring that your data remains secure in your database. This API is ideal for a range of applications, from data pipelines and API integrations to complex data conversion workflows.
      
      The essence of mapping with this API is the transformation of source records into target records. This process ranges from straightforward tasks like renaming fields (for example, changing “first_name” to “firstName”) to more complex operations such as extracting substrings from fields or concatenating multiple fields.
      
      Our Mapping API and accompanying Python library bring forth new opportunities for efficient and precise data mapping, offering customization to meet your unique needs and workflow requirements.
      
      To get started, refer to the [README](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-mapping).

      **Expanding Global Reach with Additional Languages**
      
      We've added an expansion of our language support to include a variety of new translations. This update builds upon our existing capabilities, which previously covered French, German, Indonesian, Portuguese, and Spanish.

      **New Feature Added: Disabling Actions for Empty Records in Workbook & Sheet-Mounted Actions**
      
      Developers can now add an optional flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks don’t yet have any records. This helps avoid unnecessary job failures and ensures Actions are performed only once data is present.
      
      ```json
      actions: [{
              "constraints": [{ "type": "hasData" }]
      }]
      ```
      
      [Learn more](../orchestration/actions) about all the constraints available for Sheet and Workbook Actions. or [See the Guide](../guides/actions#workbook-and-sheet-mounted) to see it in use.

      **Introducing Composite Uniqueness for Enhanced Data Integrity**
      
      We’re delighted to introduce a new constraint in Sheets aimed at bolstering data integrity. This constraint guarantees that a designated combination of two or more fields maintains uniqueness throughout the entire Sheet.
      
      To activate this feature, it’s as simple as adding certain parameters to the constraints property in your Sheet configuration. [See a breakdown](../blueprint/constraints#composite-uniqueness) of the necessary parameters to effectively implement composite uniqueness.

      **Improvements for `trackChanges` functionality**
      
      For users utilizing the `trackChanges` on their Workbooks (disables your actions until all commits are complete), we’ve addressed a critical workflow concern.
      
      Changes in a Reference field result in the creation of a new commit event, which was leaving the original commit incomplete. Furthermore, this new commit wasn’t triggering an event emission, leading to a chain of incomplete commits.
      
      We’ve refined the commit completion process: now, commits will be marked as complete whenever the user explicitly references a commit in an update request.
      
      This adjustment is handled out of the box with `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook` and ensures a more streamlined and reliable change tracking experience.

      ![image](../changelog/images/sidebar-counts.gif)
      
      Enhancements to the Spaces sidebar now offer at-a-glance insights for greater efficiency: each workbook's entry displays a count of contained Sheets, alongside a tally of records within each Sheet. Additionally, the validity of records is intuitively indicated with color-coded dots—green for valid and red for invalid—directly within the Sheet summary. This allows for quick identification and management of data accuracy.

      **Toolbar blocking jobs Extended to Workbook-Mounted Actions**
      
      We've extended the functionality of the `toolbarBlocking` job mode beyond individual Sheets. Now, when it's applied to Workbook-mounted actions, this mode also disables workbook actions (including all of the Sheets actions/toolbars) during a job's progress. By its nature, it also still allows interaction with the actual data tables.
      
      This enhancement provides more consistent control throughout your entire Workbook, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and without accidental interference or unintended navigation.

      **State-Based Messaging on Actions via Tooltips**
      
      We've introduced an exciting new capability to enhance user interaction and feedback in our application. You can now add custom messages to actions, tailored according to their state:
      
      - Error
      - Info
      
      These messages will be displayed as tooltips when users hover over an action, providing context-specific text that corresponds to the action's current state.
      
      [Follow the guide](../guides/actions#usage-7)

      **Decoupling Actions Updates from the Workbook's Schema**
      
      Previously, using workbook update endpoint necessitated submitting all the fields, even for minor adjustments to an action. Now, with our improved `PATCH` endpoint, you can update actions without needing to include the `fields` property in your payload.
      
      This refinement simplifies the update process, focusing solely on the changes you intend to make.

      Previously, users experienced difficulties in adjusting column sizes correctly when other columns were either hidden or pinned. This fix ensures seamless and accurate resizing of columns, regardless of the visibility or status of adjacent columns, enhancing the overall usability and functionality of the data table.

      **Enhanced Visibility with Status Updates During File Extraction**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/extract-status.gif)
      
      A Toast now displays intermediate states to keep you informed every step of the way during file extraction.
      
      When uploading a file directly to the table, you’ll see statuses like “Waiting for Extraction”, “Extracting”, and “Unsupported File”, along with detailed information about the outcome of extraction jobs.
      
      When uploading on the Files page, the error message is toned down to an info message, as uploading files without an extractor is a legitimate scenario.
      
      These updates are aimed at enhancing transparency and efficiency, ensuring you’re well-informed throughout the file extraction process.

      **Improved Search Functionality for Null Values in GET Records Endpoint**
      
      We've refined the search mechanism for empty cells in the GET records endpoint. In the past, users would specify `null` in the `searchValue` parameter to locate empty cells. However, this method posed ambiguity as it didn't clearly distinguish between an exact search for null values and a partial search for the string "null".
      
      Now, to accurately search for cells with null values, you should use empty double quotes `""` in the `searchValue` parameter.

      1. Customizable Checkbox Border Radius: Users now have the flexibility to theme the border radius of checkboxes, allowing for a more personalized and visually cohesive interface.
      
      2. Theming for Checkbox Border Color: Alongside border radius customization, users can also theme the border color of checkboxes, adding another layer of visual customization to match your application's aesthetic.
      
      3. Override Options in Table View: In table contexts, users have the added ability to override the default checkbox border color, offering even more control over the table's appearance and consistency with your overall design theme.
      
      These enhancements aim to provide greater flexibility and control over the UI, enabling users to tailor the look and feel of checkboxes to better align with their unique branding and design preferences.

      **Enhanced Theming options for Badges+**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/theming_badges.png)
      
      We're excited to announce new additions to our theming capabilities, allowing for even more customization and a refined user experience.
      
      **Usage**
      
      ```jsx
      "theme": {
        "root": {
          "pillBorderRadius": "0px",
          "badgeBorderRadius":"10em"
        },
        "table": {
          "buttons": {
            "pill": {
              "color": "white",
              "backgroundColor": "magenta"
            },
            "iconColor": "magenta"
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      
      **What's New:**
      
      1. Pill and Badge Border Radius Customization: You can now tailor the border radius of pills and badges within space theming. This update enables you to define and apply a consistent look across all pills and badges in the space according to your design preferences.
      
      2. Toolbar Button Color Theming: We've also introduced the option to customize the color of toolbar buttons, giving you more control over the visual style of your toolbar.
      
      3. Inherited and Customizable Toolbar Filters: Toolbar filters will automatically inherit the pill border radius settings for a unified appearance. However, this can be overridden to suit specific design needs, offering both convenience and flexibility.
      
      These enhancements are part of our ongoing commitment to providing a versatile and user-friendly platform that caters to your unique theming requirements.

      **Revamped UI for Foreground Jobs**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/foreground_facelift.png)
      
      We've given our foreground jobs a fresh, new look:
      
      1. Enhanced Job Modal Header: The job modal header now prominently displays job information, making it instantly visible and accessible.
      2. Refined Display Details: Information that was previously in the header is now elegantly presented as an ultralight subline for improved readability.
      3. Optimized Layout: We've repositioned the display of the percentage and remaining time for better clarity and focus.
      4. Improved Time Estimation: For estimated completion time, we've introduced a fallback mechanism based on simple linear extrapolation, ensuring more accurate and reliable predictions.
      
      These updates are designed to offer a more intuitive and streamlined user experience in tracking and managing foreground jobs.

      **Next Action Links in Job Outcome Dialogs Now Support Linking to internal resources**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/next_link.png)
      
      In addition to the existing ability to link to external URLs and trigger downloads, you can now also display links to internal resources upon job completion. This enhancement broadens the scope of actions you can perform, offering more versatility in directing users to relevant resources or actions post-job completion.
      
      In this code below, we will create a button that says “See all downloads” with this path: `/space/us_sp_1234/files?mode=export`
      
      **Usage**
      
      ```jsx listener
      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          message: `The file has been created`,
          acknowledge: true,
          //Reference: https://platform.flatfile.com/s/space/{$id}/{path}?{$query}
          next: {
            type: 'id',
            id: 'dev_sp_1234',
            path: 'files',
            query: 'mode=export',
            label: 'See all downloads'
          }
        }
      });
      ```

      **Enhanced Theming options for Filters**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/theming_chips.png)
      
      We've expanded the theming capabilities for filters, providing a more customizable and visually appealing interface:
      
      **Usage**
      
      ```jsx
      "theme": {
          "table": {
            "filters": {
              "outerBorder": "2px red solid",
              "innerBorderRadius": "0px",
              "outerBorderRadius": "0px"
            }
        }
      }
      ```
      
      1. New Styling Features for Filters: We've introduced the option to customize filters with borders and border radius as part of the table theme.
      
      2. Flexible Border Radius Design: To accommodate the varying sizes of elements and the potential difference in calculated border radius, we now use both inner and outer border radius settings. This enhancement not only ensures a cohesive look but also adds an extra layer of styling flexibility to the filters.
      
      These improvements are designed to offer more control over the aesthetics of filters, enabling a seamless and integrated visual experience.

      **Introducing New Endpoint for Workbook Commit Retrieval**
      
      We're excited to announce the addition of the new GET `/workbooks/{workbookId}/commits` endpoint. This improvement streamlines the process of retrieving all commits associated with a specific workbook, offering a more efficient way to determine the completion status of all processing activities on that workbook.
      
      While this enhancement primarily benefits the Flatfile UI, the endpoint is fully exposed, making it a valuable tool for developers looking to optimize commit retrieval and processing status checks in their own applications.

      **Improved Handling of Long-Running Jobs with New Timeout Feature**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/job_failure.png)
      
      To enhance clarity and efficiency in job processing, we’ve implemented an update for managing long-running jobs. Previously, jobs that weren’t acknowledged within 5 minutes would silently fail due to a timeout by the agent, leading to confusion as these jobs never reached completion (They were left in an executing state).
      
      To address this, we’ve now added a routine check that occurs every 5 minutes. This check will automatically fail jobs that are still executing but haven’t been [acknowledged](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/jobs/acknowledge-a-job) (ack’d) within this timeframe. This update ensures better transparency and control in the job execution process, reducing confusion and streamlining operations.

      ![image](../changelog/images/hasAllValid.gif)
      
      Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all rows were valid, essential for preventing unintended data egress.
      
      Now, developers can now add an optional flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records.
      
      ```jsx
      actions: [{
        ...
        constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }]
        ...
      }]
      ```
      
      Add a `constraints` parameter in your Action that includes `type: hasAllValid,` to disable actions when there are invalid records.

      We assign an 80% value to other users' history compared to the current user's history. Previously, this was only applied to field mapping, Now, this approach has been extended to enum mapping as well.
      
      This update addresses an issue where conflicting histories between two users could result in one user being unable to edit due to the other's history taking precedence.
      
      With this enhancement, the system now more effectively balances historical inputs from different users, ensuring smoother and more equitable enum mapping automation.

      **Guests can now be named in a Spaces URL**
      
      Previously, accessing Flatfile either directly through a URL or via an iframe with an `accessToken` would categorize all user activities under an anonymous guest. Now, if you know the `guestId`, interactions in Flatfile can be tied back to that person.
      
      This is made possible with a new endpoint, **/guests/:guestId/token**, which generates an accessToken, and can be used to load the Flatfile space at **http://platform.flatfile.com/space/:spaceId?token=:accessToken**.
      
      With this method, Guests are now accurately named and identifiable, enhancing user recognition and auditing.

      When either the source (file) or destination (Blueprint) list contains more than 100 enums, our mapping AI will now utilize a simplified algorithm. This change addresses scenarios where customers have extensive enum lists, such as 5,000 different Shopify products, which previously slowed down our assignment algorithm. With this update, the execution speed for such extensive lists will be faster, ensuring a more efficient and responsive experience for clients with large datasets.

      Within each Space, we've implemented an informative tooltip providing essential details about the Space. This tooltip serves as valuable support for addressing customer inquiries and issues. However, we understand that there are scenarios where you may prefer to hide this information from your customers.
      
      To accommodate your preferences, we've introduced the option to hide this Space tooltip. To make this adjustment, you can utilize the "Update Environment" patch available in our [API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/environments/update-an-environment).
      
      ```jsx

      In this update, we've implemented a crucial enhancement by unifying the casing in our API. We've resolved issues where certain properties were inconsistently cased, which had previously hindered their proper setting and retrieval.
      
      With this unification, you can now seamlessly interact with our API, ensuring a smoother and more reliable experience.

      Previously, if an existing value was present in the enum field, you couldn't select a different value from the dropdown. Additionally, when a dropdown field was empty, you were unable to use the dropdown to select a valid option, and typing out an option wasn't possible either. Both of these limitations have now been resolved.

      **Control your mapping accuracy**
      
      We're excited to announce a new parameter within Sheet configuration, aptly named `mappingConfidenceThreshold`. This parameter empowers you to fine-tune your experience when working with automatically suggested fields during mapping jobs.
      
      With `mappingConfidenceThreshold`, you have the flexibility to configure the minimum required confidence level. Think of it as a precision control, offering you the choice between conservative (exact match) or liberal (fuzzy matching) settings.
      
      **How it works**
      
      Set the value greater than 0 and up to a maximum of 1, for a more precise control over the mapping process:
      
      ```jsx workbook.js
        sheets: [
          mappingConfidenceThreshold: .6,
          {...}
        ]

      **More Precise Filtering is now Available**
      
      Now, FFQL queries made via filter: in the the search bar can be seamlessly combined with other filters. Whether you prefer using tabbed filters like “valid” and “error,” or you rely on the “Filter By Value” menu, you can now harness the power of FFQL alongside these filters.
      
      With this update, you’ll experience precise narrowing of row results every time you apply FFQL queries in conjunction with other filters. No more guesswork—your filtered results will be spot on, making it easier than ever to find the information you need with pinpoint accuracy.

      **Enhanced Cell Copying with Multi-line Preservation**
      
      We've improved the functionality for copying cells from external spreadsheets into our system. Now, when you copy cells containing more than one line, these new lines are preserved in the cell value upon pasting.
      
      While these additional lines may not be visually apparent in the table, you can verify their presence by inspecting the data through the API, or by copying and pasting the cell content into another application.
      
      This update ensures better data integrity and consistency when transferring content with complex formatting.

      **Removed Character Limit on Mappings, Jobs, and Enum Mappings**
      
      We have lifted the previous 255-character limit for mappings, jobs, and enum mappings. This update allows for greater flexibility and more detailed entries in these areas.

      **New API Feature to Restore Archived Spaces**
      
      API users now have the capability to restore an archived space. This can be done by setting the `archivedAt` property of the space to null via the `PATCH /spaces/:spaceId` endpoint.

      **Improved Cascade Deletion for Spaces, Workbooks, and Sheets**
      
      We've enhanced the deletion process for Spaces. In the past, deleting a Space did not automatically cascade to its Workbooks and Sheets. Now, with the latest update, soft deleting a Space will also soft delete its associated Workbooks and Sheets.
      
      Furthermore, we've refined the `GET /workbooks` query. It now filters out workbooks linked to previously deleted Spaces, ensuring that only relevant and active workbooks are displayed. This update is helpful for Spaces deleted before this improvement was implemented.

      **Enhanced Display of Enum Options in Turntable**
      
      We've addressed an issue in the table where enum options without a label were incorrectly displaying as 'undefined'. With the latest update, in cases where an enum option lacks a label, the table will now default to showing the option's value instead.
      
      This ensures a more accurate and user-friendly display of data.

      **Disable Actions while Hooks are Running**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/trackChanges.gif)
      
      Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all hooks had finished running, essential for ensuring data transformation completion and preventing unintended data egress. As a workaround, they resorted to creating placeholder fields that defaulted to invalid states. When a hook completed processing for a record, it marked the field as valid, allowing submission only when there were no errors in this field.
      
      Now, we're thrilled to introduce a solution to simplify this process—an all-new event: `commit:completed`. This event signals the end of all processing tasks.
      
      ```jsx
      settings: [{ trackChanges: true }];
      ```
      
      Add a `settings` parameter in your sheet that includes `trackChanges: true,` to disable actions on both Sheets and Workbooks until any pending commits have been completed.

      **New Job Mode: `toolbar-blocking`**
      
      We're excited to introduce a third job mode called `toolbarBlocking` alongside the existing `foreground` and `background` modes. With this new mode, `toolbarBlocking`, you have the flexibility to disable the Sheet Toolbar and Column Header Menus while still allowing users to enter records manually.

      **Improved copy-paste experience while bulk selecting cells**
      
      We've enhanced the bulk selection experience by enabling paste functionality. When you paste, we simply transition you out of the selection state, similar to when editing. Note: if you paste without selecting any cells, the operation will automatically apply to the bulk-selected rows.

      **New: Embed Sheets inside Documents**
      
      Now, by simply incorporating the `embed` HTML entity into your markdown body and providing the sheet ID, workbook ID, and name, you can effortlessly embed Sheets into Documents. Additionally, you have the flexibility to choose whether the embedded Sheet starts in an expanded or collapsed state when the document is loaded.
      
      ```html
      <embed
        type="embedded-sheet"
        name="Contacts"
        defaultExpanded="true"

      **Actions are now available on Documents.**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/document_actions_primary.png)
      
      Documents, which are standalone webpages within your Spaces, can now host a variety of actions, just like Workbooks, Sheets, and Files.
      
      Document-Mounted Actions have their own configuration within a Document object. The executable code within an Action is compiled into a Job entity, offering the flexibility to run asynchronously or immediately. This empowers you to create more interactive and dynamic Documents, enhancing the overall user experience within your Flatfile Spaces.
      
      ```jsx workbook.js
      //your document can now have an action that looks like this
      actions: [
        {
          operation: 'sendAction',
          mode: 'foreground',
          label: 'Send to...',
          description: 'Send this page to someone.',
          primary: true,
        },
        {...}

      **The API now supports two new actions: `sheets.lock` and `sheets.unlock`.**
      
      With the introduction of these API actions, you gain the ability to manage sheet locking within your application. The `sheets.lock` action allows you to lock a sheet, preventing any further modifications to its content. Conversely, the `sheets.unlock` action enables you to release the lock and restore full editing capabilities to the sheet.
      
      These new API actions provide greater control and flexibility when it comes to managing sheet access and data integrity.

      **New: Full-screen Documents!**
      
      Documents have gained a new capability, allowing them to seamlessly transition into full-screen takeovers, thus removing their presence from the sidebar.
      
      **How it works:**
      
      To enable this functionality, we've introduced a new property on Documents: `treatments`. This property allows users to define specific descriptors for each Document. When a Document is assigned the "ephemeral" treatment, it will transform into a full-screen overlay, visible exclusively within the Spaces dashboard, while being discreetly tucked away from the Spaces sidebar.
      
      This enhancement enhances user creativity and provides the freedom to tailor document-driven interactions precisely to their needs.
      
      ```ts
      await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
        treatments: ['ephemeral'],
        title: 'Getting Started'
      });

      When acknowledging a job from a Workbook or Sheet action, you now have the option to set the `estimatedCompletionAt` parameter. Setting the estimated time of completion for the job leads to more informative and interactive features in the UI.
      
      1. In the Foreground Job overlay, you'll see real-time progress displayed as a percentage, along with an estimate of the remaining time.
      
      2. Additionally, the Jobs Panel will share visibility into the estimated remaining time for acknowledged jobs.

      The find/replace operation is now able to handle large datasets. Now, records are batched into groups of 10,000 rows, and a unique versionId is assigned to each batch. Additionally, the workbook service will emit events for each batch processed.
      
      This improvement is particularly beneficial for @flatfile/plugin-record-hook, which can now retrieve and respond to all records in a single find/replace operation, thanks to the 10,000-row batching.

      When adding a secret to a space via the API, we have expanded the flexibility of secret names.

      **Now Available: Accept Dynamic Inputs on Actions**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/action_inputs.png)
      
      Now, when initiating an action, you have the option to gather additional information from end users to facilitate the successful completion of the intended task.
      
      **Here’s how it works:**
      
      Suppose you want to allow users to specify the name of the file they intend to export. In such cases, you can configure input fields for your action. When an end user triggers this action, a secondary dialog will appear, prompting them to provide the necessary information.
      
      **The available input types include:**
      
      - `string`: For capturing text-based information.
      - `textarea`: Ideal for longer text entries or descriptions.
      - `number`: To collect numeric data.
      - `boolean`: For simple yes/no or true/false responses.
      - `enum`: Enables users to select from a predefined list of options.
      
      **Two easy ways to get started:**

      ![image](../changelog/images/addl_fields.png)
      
      With additional fields, end users can seamlessly map to fields that don’t exist by simply adding a new property to any of your new or pre-existing Blueprint(s).
      
      Here’s how it works:
      
      - When you set allowAdditionalFields to true, your Sheet gains the ability to accept additional fields, extending beyond what’s originally specified in its configuration.
      - These extra fields can be incorporated, either through API integrations or by end users during the file import process.
      - Fields that go beyond the Blueprint’s initial setup are marked with a treatment property set to additional, ensuring complete transparency over what extends the Blueprint.
      - What’s more, adding a custom field is a breeze—its name will be automatically set to match the header name from the file being mapped. This simplifies the process.

      Our aim is to make it easy for everyone to monitor events, find problems, and help developers avoid overcomplicating their code with excessive Console logs that would need removal later.
      
      With our enhanced Event logs, you can now:
      
      1. View a comprehensive list of logged events, categorized by event topic.
      2. Easily discern the status of each event.
      3. Gauge the execution time of each event.
      4. Access events chronologically, with the most recent at the top.
      5. Dive into each event for context and review any associated console logs.
      
      As an added bonus, you have the capability to filter events, focusing solely on failures.

      Choosing a `namespace` on Space creation is now easier than ever. Rather than manually typing the namespaces into a free-form text field, you can simply choose from a dropdown menu of available options.

      We've revamped the way partial replaces work, enhancing your data editing experience for maximum smoothness and intuitiveness. In the past, when you attempted to replace specific characters with an empty string (""), it occasionally resulted in the cell value becoming null, which wasn't quite what you had in mind.
      
      For instance, if you needed to eliminate dashes from UUID fields, you'd naturally want "abc-123" to transform into "abc123" rather than mysteriously turning null.
      
      We value your feedback. Now, you can confidently perform partial replacements without the hassle of unexpected null values.

      We've made improvements behind the scenes to ensure that your data gets mapped with more precision. Previously, some data could be missed during mapping, but now, we're considering both the option labels and values, making sure nothing is left behind. This means you'll have a smoother and more reliable experience when mapping your data, ensuring that everything is captured correctly.

      ![image](../changelog/images/primary_actions.png)
      
      Previously, the `primary:true` concept on Actions didn't affect Sheet actions, leaving them all in the "more actions" drop-down. But now, setting primary to true will showcase these actions right in the Sheet toolbar, as buttons with clear, user-friendly text.

      **New Job Outcome Acknowledgements**
      
      **`acknowledge: false`**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_modal.png)
      
      By default, job outcomes are reported through a toast notification in the top-right corner. To utilize this, simply set `outcome => message`. This approach ensures that your job completion status is promptly communicated to the end user.
      
      **`acknowledge: true`**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_fullscreen.png)
      
      When the `acknowledge` option is configured as `true`, a persistent full-screen modal is presented. This modal remains visible until the user interacts by clicking the "Continue" button, acknowledging the outcome.
      
      **Usage**
      
      ```jsx
      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          acknowlege: true,
          message: 'Text here.'
        }
      });
      ```
      
      This enhancement provides flexibility in how you choose to inform users about job outcomes. [Learn more](../guides/actions#usage).

    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      **Enhanced Job Outcomes with Next Action Links**
      
      Job outcomes have been upgraded to support `next` action links. Now, you can display links to external URLs, trigger downloads, or retry jobes upon job completion/failure.
      
      **Usage**
      
      ```jsx listener
      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          next: Url | Download | Retry,
          message: 'Text here.'
        }
      });
      ```
      
      This improvement adds versatility and flexibility to your job outcomes, enhancing user interaction and experience.

      **Enhanced Action Button Behavior**
      
      ![image](../changelog/images/hasAllValid.gif)
      
      Two key enhancements to Actions have been introduced:
      
      **Disable Actions When Invalid Records**: Developers can now add an optional flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records. This helps avoid unnecessary job failures and ensures Actions are performed on valid data.
      
      ```jsx
      constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }],
      ```
      
      **Disable Actions When No Selected Records:** To enhance the user experience, we've introduced the `hasSelection` flag. When added as a constraint, this flag disables Actions if no records are selected in the Sheet or Workbook, ensuring Actions are only triggered when relevant data is chosen.
      
      ```jsx
      constraints: [ { type: 'hasSelection' }],
      ```

    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      **Improved FFQL handling of dates and number comparisons**
      
      **Enhanced Number Field Queries:**
      
      When conducting equality or inequality FFQL comparisons for `number` fields, the query value is now cast to a number and then compared with the parsed "shadow" value. This rectifies issues related to numeric comparisons. Additionally, we've resolved a bug where numbers with no digits before the decimal point (e.g., ".3") were not being properly parsed into shadow values.
      
      **Advanced Date Field Handling:**
      
      For `date` fields, query values are now attempted to be parsed into dates. On the SQL side, a `CASE` statement is employed to parse the stored values into dates for accurate comparison. To accommodate SQL-side date parsing requirements, we've integrated a regex pattern to detect `YYYY-MM-DD`, `m/d/yy`, and `m/d/yyyy` formats. This ensures correct parsing and comparison of date values.
      
      **Fix for Invalid Number Input:**
      
      We've resolved a bug where changing a number field to an invalid number left the previous "shadow" value intact. Now, in such cases, the previous shadow value is properly cleared, leading to consistent and accurate behavior.
      
      These updates contribute to improved query handling, better data integrity, and a more seamless experience when working with number and date fields.

      # ![image](../changelog/images/tooltips-actions.png)
      
      We've introduced a new parameter: `tooltip` to Actions, allowing the addition of tooltips. These tooltips are now visible in the user interface for both buttons and list items whenever the associated Action is enabled. This enhancement provides users with clear and context-aware explanations for enabled Actions, contributing to an improved overall user experience.

      Fixed a cosmetic issue with scrolling through Workbooks. The problem stemmed from the outer container scrolling based on the inner content's height. By applying overflow properties to the inner component, which holds a list of items within a flex container, we have resolved this issue.

      A pagination logic issue concerning **Environments** has been resolved. The correction ensures accurate calculation of the number of pages and consistent delivery of valid responses in accordance with the [Pagination](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/api/1dcb99aada63f-pagination) type.
      
      Furthermore, the default page size for **Spaces** has been set to 10, aligning it with the specifications outlined in the API documentation.

      The API specification has been updated to facilitate the mapping of `enum` values of various types such as `string`, `integer`, or `boolean`. This modification effectively resolves a server error response that was previously encountered when utilizing such `enum` values within the API.
      
      In addition, the loading state of the "Continue" button has been refined to ensure smooth recovery from server errors. This adjustment enhances the overall user experience by providing more graceful handling of unexpected issues during the process.

      **🚀 Instant Extraction for CSV/TSV/PSV Files**
      
      With the removal of the extraction step for CSV/TSV/PSV files, the import experience is now more seamless than ever. As soon as the upload is complete, these files are instantly extracted, ensuring an efficient and immediate handling of your data.
      
      The impact of this change is remarkable. What used to take approximately 3 and a half minutes to extract now concludes in less than 10 seconds.
      
      In addition, we now natively support TSV and PSV files meaning you don't need to use an extractor plugin to support these file types.
      
      While speed is the prime advantage, this upgrade doesn’t merely boost performance. It also simplifies and enhances reliability in our system. Previously, concerns about only a fraction of a file being extracted are now history. Furthermore, this approach strategically eases the load on our database, reducing the likelihood of encountering resource limits.
      
      In essence, it’s a win-win for both efficiency and user experience.

      Now, you can set a description for each Option Field value via API.
      End users can then view this description as a tooltip during mapping.

      We've added new API routes to capture up to 5 snapshots of a Sheet, with the
      flexibility to restore any of them using the API at your convenience. Stay
      tuned as we prepare to bring this functionality to the UI as well.

      Metadata allows you to store and retrieve additional data about a Space,
      Record, or Field without exposing it to end users. Now, Environments also
      have a `metadata` string array.

    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      There is now a count at the top of the files list that shows the total
      number of files.

      The Sidebar now has three different states:
      
      - Collapsed state
      - Open state
      - Totally hidden state
      
      Additionally, the Sidebar will now automatically collapse itself on smaller screens.

    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      We now handle overflowing space name(s) by:
      
      - Breaking the word
      - Limiting the name to two lines and giving it an ellipsis if it overflows
      - Adding a tooltip with the space name to truncated names
      - Previously, badge names in the data checklist could break to two lines making them hard to read. This is also fixed.

      When determining the lighter shades of each main theme colors, i.e. primary,
      danger, warning and success, there are now checks to ensure no colors end up
      as white.

      they are currently mapping.

      Filter: "Last Name" like A% will now retrieve all records where Last Name
      starts with “A”. Previously, it was retrieving records that contained “A”.

      The continue button is now disabled on mapping scene while mappings are
      loading. This ensures user can only advance to review scene after mappings
      are saved.
