      **Introducing: Code Blocks for Documents**

      ![image](../changelog/images/documents_codeblocks.png)

      We've introduced the ability to add code blocks to your Documents. You can now use the following syntax to define code blocks and specify the language:

      ![image](../changelog/images/documents_codeblocks_sample.png)

    Your code will be formatted accordingly, enhancing the clarity and presentation of your content.

    Previously, guests without access to the specific workbook would encounter a "Workbook Not Found" error. Now, a fallback mechanism has been implemented to validate access to the `primaryWorkbook`, ensuring a smoother experience for users.

       Resolved an issue where the import button could prematurely appear before a file was ready to be imported. This was due to an early update of the file's status with a workbook ID, which has now been adjusted to wait until the data is queriable before updating. The import process now aligns better with the file's readiness.

      **New Job Outcome Acknowledgements**

      **`acknowledge: false`**

      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_modal.png)

      By default, job outcomes are reported through a toast notification in the top-right corner. To utilize this, simply set `outcome => message`. This approach ensures that your job completion status is promptly communicated to the end user.

      **`acknowledge: true`**

      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_fullscreen.png)

      When the `acknowledge` option is configured as `true`, a persistent full-screen modal is presented. This modal remains visible until the user interacts by clicking the "Continue" button, acknowledging the outcome.

      **Usage**

      ```jsx
      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          acknowlege: true,
          message:
            "Text here.",
        },
      });
      ```

      This enhancement provides flexibility in how you choose to inform users about job outcomes. [Learn more](http://flatfile.com/docs/guides/actions#usage).

      }}
    >
        **Enhanced Job Outcomes with Next Action Links**

      Job outcomes have been upgraded to support `next` action links. Now, you can display links to external URLs, Flatfile resources, or trigger downloads upon job completion.

      **Usage**
        <CodeGroup>
        ```jsx listener
        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            next: IdNext | WaitNext | UrlNext | DownloadNext,
            message:
              "Text here.",
          },
        });
        ```
        ```jsx Types
        type IdNext = {
          type: 'id' //link to a Flatfile resource
          id: string
        }

        type WaitNext = {
          type: 'wait' //only used in embedded Flatfile
        }

        type UrlNext = {
          type: 'url' //display a link to an external url
          url: string
          label: string
        }

        type DownloadNext = {
          type: 'download' // display and trigger a download
          url: string
          fileName: string
          label: string
        }
        ```

        **Enhanced Action Button Behavior**

        ![image](../changelog/images/disabled_actions.png)

       Two key enhancements to Actions have been introduced:

        **Disable Actions When Invalid Records**: Developers can now add an optional `requireAllValid` flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records. This helps avoid unnecessary job failures and ensures Actions are performed on valid data.

        **Disable Actions When No Selected Records:** To enhance the user experience, we've introduced the `requireSelection` flag. When set to `true`, this flag disables Actions if no records are selected in the Sheet or Workbook, ensuring Actions are only triggered when relevant data is chosen.

      }}
    >
    **Improved FFQL handling of dates and number comparisons**

      **Enhanced Number Field Queries:** When conducting equality or inequality FFQL comparisons for `number` fields, the query value is now cast to a number and then compared with the parsed "shadow" value. This rectifies issues related to numeric comparisons. Additionally, we've resolved a bug where numbers with no digits before the decimal point (e.g., ".3") were not being properly parsed into shadow values.

      **Advanced Date Field Handling:** For `date` fields, query values are now attempted to be parsed into dates. On the SQL side, a `CASE` statement is employed to parse the stored values into dates for accurate comparison. To accommodate SQL-side date parsing requirements, we've integrated a regex pattern to detect `YYYY-MM-DD`, `m/d/yy`, and `m/d/yyyy` formats. This ensures correct parsing and comparison of date values.

      **Fix for Invalid Number Input:** We've resolved a bug where changing a number field to an invalid number left the previous "shadow" value intact. Now, in such cases, the previous shadow value is properly cleared, leading to consistent and accurate behavior.

      These updates contribute to improved query handling, better data integrity, and a more seamless experience when working with number and date fields.

      ![image](../changelog/images/tooltips-actions.png)

      We've introduced a new parameter: `tooltip` to Actions, allowing the addition of tooltips. These tooltips are now visible in the user interface for both buttons and list items whenever the associated Action is enabled. This enhancement provides users with clear and context-aware explanations for enabled Actions, contributing to an improved overall user experience.

      Fixed a cosmetic issue with scrolling through Workbooks. The problem stemmed from the outer container scrolling based on the inner content's height. By applying overflow properties to the inner component, which holds a list of items within a flex container, we have resolved this issue.

      **🚀 Instant Extraction for CSV/TSV/PSV Files**

      We’re thrilled to introduce a significant enhancement to our import process. With the removal of the extraction step for CSV/TSV/PSV files, the import experience is now more seamless than ever. As soon as the upload is complete, these files are instantly extracted, ensuring an efficient and immediate handling of your data.

      The impact of this change is remarkable. What used to take approximately 3 and a half minutes to extract now concludes in less than 10 seconds.

      In addition, we now natively support TSV and PSV files meaning you don't need to use an extractor plugin to support these file types.

      While speed is the prime advantage, this upgrade doesn’t merely boost performance. It also simplifies and enhances reliability in our system. Previously, concerns about only a fraction of a file being extracted are now history. Furthermore, this approach strategically eases the load on our database, reducing the likelihood of encountering resource limits.

      In essence, it’s a win-win for both efficiency and user experience.

        The Sidebar now has three different states:
        - Collapsed state
        - Open state
        - Totally hidden state

        Additionally, the Sidebar will now automatically collapse itself on smaller screens.

        We now handle overflowing space name(s) by:
        - Breaking the word
        - Limiting the name to two lines and giving it an ellipsis if it overflows
        - Adding a tooltip with the space name to truncated names
        - Previously, badge names in the data checklist could break to two lines making them hard to read. This is also fixed.
