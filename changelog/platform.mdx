         **Now Available: Accept Dynamic Inputs on Actions**

        ![image](../changelog/images/action_inputs.png)

        Now, when initiating an action, you have the option to gather additional information from end users to facilitate the successful completion of the intended task.

        **Here’s how it works:**

        Suppose you want to allow users to specify the name of the file they intend to export. In such cases, you can configure input fields for your action. When an end user triggers this action, a secondary dialog will appear, prompting them to provide the necessary information.

        **The available input types include:**

        - `string`: For capturing text-based information.
        - `textarea`: Ideal for longer text entries or descriptions.
        - `number`: To collect numeric data.
        - `boolean`: For simple yes/no or true/false responses.
        - `enum`: Enables users to select from a predefined list of options.

        **Two easy ways to get started:**

        - Learn about all the parameters available on `inputForm` for Actions [here](http://flatfile.com/docs/concepts/actions#inputform).
        - Or follow this copy/paste [Guide](http://flatfile.com/docs/guides/actions#actions-with-input-forms) to quickly see it in action in your code.

        **Exciting Update: Additional Fields**

        ![image](../changelog/images/addl_fields.png)

        With additional fields, end users can seamlessly map to fields that don’t exist by simply adding a new property to any of your new or pre-existing Blueprint(s).

        Here’s how it works:
        - When you set allowAdditionalFields to true, your Sheet gains the ability to accept additional fields, extending beyond what’s originally specified in its configuration.
        - These extra fields can be incorporated, either through API integrations or by end users during the file import process.
        - Fields that go beyond the Blueprint’s initial setup are marked with a treatment property set to additional, ensuring complete transparency over what extends the Blueprint.
        - What’s more, adding a custom field is a breeze—its name will be automatically set to match the header name from the file being mapped. This simplifies the process.

        [See the docs](https://flatfile.com/docs/blueprint/sheet-options).

        **Introducing New and Enhanced Event Logs**

        ![image](../changelog/images/event_logs.png)

        Our aim is to make it easy for everyone to monitor events, find problems, and help developers avoid overcomplicating their code with excessive Console logs that would need removal later.

        With our enhanced Event logs, you can now:

        1. View a comprehensive list of logged events, categorized by event topic.
        2. Easily discern the status of each event.
        3. Gauge the execution time of each event.
        4. Access events chronologically, with the most recent at the top.
        5. Dive into each event for context and review any associated console logs.

        As an added bonus, you have the capability to filter events, focusing solely on failures.

          width: "calc(80% - 30px)",
        }}
      >

       Choosing a `namespace` on Space creation is now easier than ever. Rather than manually typing the namespaces into a free-form text field, you can simply choose from a dropdown menu of available options. The available namespaces are conveniently listed within the `namespaces` array of the Environment, providing a more efficient and accurate way to handle namespace selection.

        Previously, when using the find and replace feature, only the initial batch of records had data hooks run again. Now, the find/replace operation efficiently groups records into batches of 10,000 rows, assigning a unique versionId to each batch. This improvement empowers record-hooks to process all records seamlessly within a single find/replace operation.

      >

       Now, you can include a free-form JSON object as `metadata` on your Workbook, providing you with a flexible way to store additional information related to it. Whether you're creating a new Workbook or updating an existing one, you have the option to enrich your Workbooks with meaningful metadata.

        Previously, when adding a secret to a space through the API, we supported spaces in secret names. However, the UI had regex logic that filtered out spaces when validating secret names.

        In this update, we've harmonized the process by accepting space characters as valid characters for secret names in both the API and the UI. Your secret names can now include spaces without any issues.

          width: "calc(80% - 30px)",
        }}
      >

        We've resolved an issue where long messages would overflow the cell in validation messages. By implementing a straightforward `word-break` property, your validation messages will now display lengthy messages more elegantly.

        We've revamped the way partial replaces work, enhancing your data editing experience for maximum smoothness and intuitiveness. In the past, when you attempted to replace specific characters with an empty string (""), it occasionally resulted in the cell value becoming null, which wasn't quite what you had in mind.

        For instance, if you needed to eliminate dashes from UUID fields, you'd naturally want "abc-123" to transform into "abc123" rather than mysteriously turning null.

        We value your feedback. Now, you can confidently perform partial replacements without the hassle of unexpected null values.

        We've made improvements behind the scenes to ensure that your data gets mapped with more precision. Previously, some data could be missed during mapping, but now, we're considering both the option labels and values, making sure nothing is left behind. This means you'll have a smoother and more reliable experience when mapping your data, ensuring that everything is captured correctly.

        **Localization is Now Available**

        ![image](../changelog/images/localization.png)


        We are excited to introduce localization features in Flatfile! Now, your customers will enjoy automatic translations based on their browser locale, including French, German, and Spanish.

        Key Features:

        - Translations are exclusively applied in Spaces (guest areas).
        - Our user-friendly guide will assist you in effortlessly translating and personalizing the content within your space, whether it's custom actions, documents, and more.
        - Require another language? Send us a note, and we'll make it a priority to include it.

        [Follow the guide](https://flatfile.com/docs/guides/localization) or try the [Localization demo Space](https://platform.flatfile.com/getting-started) to get started.

        **New: Promote Sheet Actions**

        ![image](../changelog/images/primary_actions.png)

       Previously, the `primary:true` concept on Actions didn't affect Sheet actions, leaving them all in the "more actions" drop-down. But now, setting primary to true will showcase these actions right in the Sheet toolbar, as buttons with clear, user-friendly text.

      **New Job Outcome Acknowledgements**

      **`acknowledge: false`**

      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_modal.png)

      By default, job outcomes are reported through a toast notification in the top-right corner. To utilize this, simply set `outcome => message`. This approach ensures that your job completion status is promptly communicated to the end user.

      **`acknowledge: true`**

      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_fullscreen.png)

      When the `acknowledge` option is configured as `true`, a persistent full-screen modal is presented. This modal remains visible until the user interacts by clicking the "Continue" button, acknowledging the outcome.

      **Usage**

      ```jsx
      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          acknowlege: true,
          message:
            "Text here.",
        },

        **Enhanced Job Outcomes with Next Action Links**

      Job outcomes have been upgraded to support `next` action links. Now, you can display links to external URLs, Flatfile resources, or trigger downloads upon job completion.

      **Usage**
        <CodeGroup>
        ```jsx listener
        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            next: IdNext | WaitNext | UrlNext | DownloadNext,
            message:
              "Text here.",
          },
        });
        ```
        ```jsx Types
        type IdNext = {
          type: 'id' //link to a Flatfile resource
          id: string
        }

        type WaitNext = {
          type: 'wait' //only used in embedded Flatfile
        }

        type UrlNext = {
          type: 'url' //display a link to an external url
          url: string
          label: string
        }

        type DownloadNext = {
          type: 'download' // display and trigger a download
          url: string
          fileName: string
          label: string

        **Enhanced Action Button Behavior**

        ![image](../changelog/images/disabled_actions.png)

       Two key enhancements to Actions have been introduced:

        **Disable Actions When Invalid Records**: Developers can now add an optional `requireAllValid` flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records. This helps avoid unnecessary job failures and ensures Actions are performed on valid data.

        **Disable Actions When No Selected Records:** To enhance the user experience, we've introduced the `requireSelection` flag. When set to `true`, this flag disables Actions if no records are selected in the Sheet or Workbook, ensuring Actions are only triggered when relevant data is chosen.

      }}
    >
    **Improved FFQL handling of dates and number comparisons**

      **Enhanced Number Field Queries:** When conducting equality or inequality FFQL comparisons for `number` fields, the query value is now cast to a number and then compared with the parsed "shadow" value. This rectifies issues related to numeric comparisons. Additionally, we've resolved a bug where numbers with no digits before the decimal point (e.g., ".3") were not being properly parsed into shadow values.

      **Advanced Date Field Handling:** For `date` fields, query values are now attempted to be parsed into dates. On the SQL side, a `CASE` statement is employed to parse the stored values into dates for accurate comparison. To accommodate SQL-side date parsing requirements, we've integrated a regex pattern to detect `YYYY-MM-DD`, `m/d/yy`, and `m/d/yyyy` formats. This ensures correct parsing and comparison of date values.

      **Fix for Invalid Number Input:** We've resolved a bug where changing a number field to an invalid number left the previous "shadow" value intact. Now, in such cases, the previous shadow value is properly cleared, leading to consistent and accurate behavior.

      These updates contribute to improved query handling, better data integrity, and a more seamless experience when working with number and date fields.

This enhancement provides users with clear and context-aware explanations for enabled Actions, contributing to an improved overall user experience.

      **🚀 Instant Extraction for CSV/TSV/PSV Files**

      We’re thrilled to introduce a significant enhancement to our import process. With the removal of the extraction step for CSV/TSV/PSV files, the import experience is now more seamless than ever. As soon as the upload is complete, these files are instantly extracted, ensuring an efficient and immediate handling of your data.

      The impact of this change is remarkable. What used to take approximately 3 and a half minutes to extract now concludes in less than 10 seconds.

      In addition, we now natively support TSV and PSV files meaning you don't need to use an extractor plugin to support these file types.

      While speed is the prime advantage, this upgrade doesn’t merely boost performance. It also simplifies and enhances reliability in our system. Previously, concerns about only a fraction of a file being extracted are now history. Furthermore, this approach strategically eases the load on our database, reducing the likelihood of encountering resource limits.

      In essence, it’s a win-win for both efficiency and user experience.
