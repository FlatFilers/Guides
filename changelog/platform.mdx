        **You can now disable Actions when there are invalid records**

        ![image](../changelog/images/hasAllValid.gif)

        Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all rows were valid, essential for preventing unintended data egress.

        Now, developers can now add an optional flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records.


        ```jsx
        actions: [{
          ...
          constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }]
          ...
        }]
        ```

         Add a `constraints` parameter in your Action that includes `type: hasAllValid,` to disable actions when there are invalid records.

          width: "calc(80% - 30px)",
        }}
      >

        We made an enhancement to bulk cell pasting. Previously, locking the cell occurred prematurely, causing values to flash after pasting. Now, locking is effectively executed later, resulting in a smoother and more stable pasting experience.

        **Space ID Search is now available in the Spaces Table**

        ![image](../changelog/images/search_spaces.gif)

        We've added a new feature that allows you to search for spaces using their Space ID in the Spaces table. This enhancement simplifies the process of locating specific spaces quickly and efficiently.

         **Enhanced Weighting Mechanism for User History in Enum Mapping**

        We assign an 80% value to other users' history compared to the current user's history. Previously, this was only applied to field mapping, Now, this approach has been extended to enum mapping as well.

        This update addresses an issue where conflicting histories between two users could result in one user being unable to edit due to the other's history taking precedence.

        With this enhancement, the system now more effectively balances historical inputs from different users, ensuring smoother and more equitable enum mapping automation.

         *It's the little things*: Bulk delete in Spaces is now available***

        ![image](../changelog/images/bulk_delete_sm.gif)

        We’ve added a new feature that allows for the selection and bulk deletion of Spaces from your list. This enhancement is particularly beneficial for customers managing numerous Spaces, as it eliminates the need to delete each Space individually, significantly streamlining the process and saving time. Enjoy!

        **New: Column Visibility Control with Local Storage Memory**

         ![image](../changelog/images/column_hiding.gif)

        We've introduced a new feature that allows for selective hiding or showing of columns, enabling users to customize their view for more focused work. Additionally, your column visibility preferences will now be automatically saved to local storage, ensuring that your personalized settings are remembered for future sessions. This update aims to enhance user efficiency by allowing you to tailor the interface to your specific needs and workflow.

      >

        **Guests can now be named in a Spaces URL**

        Previously, accessing Flatfile either directly through a URL or via an iframe with an `accessToken` would categorize all user activities under an anonymous guest. Now, if you know the `guestId`, interactions in Flatfile can be tied back to that person.

        This is made possible with a new endpoint, **/guests/:guestId/token**, which generates an accessToken, and can be used to load the Flatfile space at **http://platform.flatfile.com/space/:spaceId?token=:accessToken**.

        With this method, Guests are now accurately named and identifiable, enhancing user recognition and auditing.

        [See the endpoint](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/api/67620eaca4fde-get-a-guest-token).

        **Speed Optimization for Large Enum Lists**

        When either the source (file) or destination (Blueprint) list contains more than 100 enums, our mapping AI will now utilize a simplified algorithm. This change addresses scenarios where customers have extensive enum lists, such as 5,000 different Shopify products, which previously slowed down our assignment algorithm. With this update, the execution speed for such extensive lists will be significantly faster, ensuring a more efficient and responsive experience for clients with large datasets.

       **Fixed File Extraction for Workbook-Only Guests**

      We’ve fixed an issue where guests with [workbook-only access](http://flatfile.com/docs/developer-tools/security/roles-and-permissions#workbook-grant) could upload files but couldn’t extract them due to access restrictions. Guests can now upload and extract files smoothly in workbooks they have access to.

        **Full Whitelabeling now available in Pro+**

        ![image](../changelog/images/whitelabeling.png)

        There are a few places where the Flatfile logo appears to your end customers.

        1. The **Powered By Flatfile** logo appears in the bottom right of Workbooks.
        2. When sending invitations to Users or Guests, the Flatfile logo is included at the top of the emails.

        For those seeking a complete white-labeling experience, we offer a fully customizable solution as part of our Pro plans and above. Feel free to get in touch with us at [support@flatfile.com](mailto:support@flatfile.com) to discuss the possibilities of a fully whitelabeled experience tailored to your needs.

        **Hide the info Tooltip**

        ![image](../changelog/images/infotooltip.png)

        Within each Space, we've implemented an informative tooltip providing essential details about the Space. This tooltip serves as valuable support for addressing customer inquiries and issues. However, we understand that there are scenarios where you may prefer to hide this information from your customers.

        To accommodate your preferences, we've introduced the option to hide this Space tooltip. To make this adjustment, you can utilize the "Update Environment" patch available in our [API Reference](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/api/20058726b7884-update-an-environment).

        ```jsx
        metadata: {
            showSpaceInfo: false
          }
        ```
    </div>

  </div>
  <div style={{ display: "table-row", width: "auto" }}>
      <Snippet file="chips/core.mdx" />
      <div
        style={{
          float: "left",
          display: "table-column",
          paddingLeft: "30px",
          width: "calc(80% - 30px)",
        }}
      >

        In this update, we've implemented a crucial enhancement by unifying the casing in our API. We've resolved issues where certain properties were inconsistently cased, which had previously hindered their proper setting and retrieval.

        With this unification, you can now seamlessly interact with our API, ensuring a smoother and more reliable experience.

          paddingLeft: "30px",
          width: "calc(80% - 30px)",
        }}
      >

        Previously, if an existing value was present in the enum field, you couldn't select a different value from the dropdown. Additionally, when a dropdown field was empty, you were unable to use the dropdown to select a valid option, and typing out an option wasn't possible either. Both of these limitations have now been resolved.

        **Control your mapping accuracy**

        We're excited to announce a new parameter within Sheet configuration, aptly named `mappingConfidenceThreshold`. This parameter empowers you to fine-tune your experience when working with automatically suggested fields during mapping jobs.

        With `mappingConfidenceThreshold`, you have the flexibility to configure the minimum required confidence level. Think of it as a precision control, offering you the choice between conservative (exact match) or liberal (fuzzy matching) settings.

        **How it works**

        Set the value greater than 0 and up to a maximum of 1, for a more precise control over the mapping process:

        ```jsx workbook.js
          sheets: [
            mappingConfidenceThreshold: .6,
            {...}
          ]
        ```

          width: "calc(80% - 30px)",
        }}
      >
        **More Precise Filtering is now Available**

        Now, FFQL queries made via filter: in the the search bar can be seamlessly combined with other filters. Whether you prefer using tabbed filters like “valid” and “error,” or you rely on the “Filter By Value” menu, you can now harness the power of FFQL alongside these filters.

        With this update, you’ll experience precise narrowing of row results every time you apply FFQL queries in conjunction with other filters. No more guesswork—your filtered results will be spot on, making it easier than ever to find the information you need with pinpoint accuracy.

      >

        **Enhanced Cell Copying with Multi-line Preservation**

        We've improved the functionality for copying cells from external spreadsheets into our system. Now, when you copy cells containing more than one line, these new lines are preserved in the cell value upon pasting.

        While these additional lines may not be visually apparent in the table, you can verify their presence by inspecting the data through the API, or by copying and pasting the cell content into another application.

        This update ensures better data integrity and consistency when transferring content with complex formatting.

        **Improved Cascade Deletion for Spaces, Workbooks, and Sheets**

        We've enhanced the deletion process for Spaces. In the past, deleting a Space did not automatically cascade to its Workbooks and Sheets. Now, with the latest update, soft deleting a Space will also soft delete its associated Workbooks and Sheets.

        Furthermore, we've refined the `GET /workbooks` query. It now filters out workbooks linked to previously deleted Spaces, ensuring that only relevant and active workbooks are displayed. This update is helpful for Spaces deleted before this improvement was implemented.

        This ensures a more accurate and user-friendly display of data.

        **Disable Actions while Hooks are Running**

        ![image](../changelog/images/trackChanges.gif)

        Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all hooks had finished running, essential for ensuring data transformation completion and preventing unintended data egress. As a workaround, they resorted to creating placeholder fields that defaulted to invalid states. When a hook completed processing for a record, it marked the field as valid, allowing submission only when there were no errors in this field.

        Now, we're thrilled to introduce a solution to simplify this process—an all-new event: `commit:completed`. This event signals the end of all processing tasks.


        ```jsx
        settings : [{ trackChanges: true }]
        ```

         Add a `settings` parameter in your sheet that includes `trackChanges: true,` to disable actions on both Sheets and Workbooks until any pending commits have been completed.

        **New: Embed Sheets inside Documents**

        Now, by simply incorporating the `embed` HTML entity into your markdown body and providing the sheet ID, workbook ID, and name, you can effortlessly embed Sheets into Documents. Additionally, you have the flexibility to choose whether the embedded Sheet starts in an expanded or collapsed state when the document is loaded.

        ```html
        <embed
          type="embedded-sheet"
          name="Contacts"
          defaultExpanded="true"
          sheetId="your_sheet_id"
          workbookId="your_workbook_id"
        />
        ```

        This enhancement provides further freedom to tailor document-driven interactions precisely to your needs.

        **Actions are now available on Documents.**

        ![image](../changelog/images/document_actions_primary.png)

       Documents, which are standalone webpages within your Spaces, can now host a variety of actions, just like Workbooks, Sheets, and Files.

        Document-Mounted Actions have their own configuration within a Document object. The executable code within an Action is compiled into a Job entity, offering the flexibility to run asynchronously or immediately. This empowers you to create more interactive and dynamic Documents, enhancing the overall user experience within your Flatfile Spaces.

        ```jsx workbook.js
        //your document can now have an action that looks like this
        actions: [
          {
            operation: 'sendAction',
            mode: 'foreground',
            label: 'Send to...',
            description: 'Send this page to someone.',
            primary: true,
          },
          {...}
        ]

        **The API now supports two new actions: `sheets.lock` and `sheets.unlock`.**

        With the introduction of these API actions, you gain the ability to manage sheet locking within your application. The `sheets.lock` action allows you to lock a sheet, preventing any further modifications to its content. Conversely, the `sheets.unlock` action enables you to release the lock and restore full editing capabilities to the sheet.

        These new API actions provide greater control and flexibility when it comes to managing sheet access and data integrity.

        **New: Full-screen Documents!**

        Documents have gained a new capability, allowing them to seamlessly transition into full-screen takeovers, thus removing their presence from the sidebar.

        **How it works:**

        To enable this functionality, we've introduced a new property on Documents: `treatments`. This property allows users to define specific descriptors for each Document. When a Document is assigned the "ephemeral" treatment, it will transform into a full-screen overlay, visible exclusively within the Spaces dashboard, while being discreetly tucked away from the Spaces sidebar.

        This enhancement enhances user creativity and provides the freedom to tailor document-driven interactions precisely to their needs.

        ```ts
        await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
          treatments: ['ephemeral'],
          title: "Getting Started"
        });

         When acknowledging a job from a Workbook or Sheet action, you now have the option to set the `estimatedCompletionAt` parameter. Setting the estimated time of completion for the job leads to more informative and interactive features in the UI.
         1. In the Foreground Job overlay, you'll see real-time progress displayed as a percentage, along with an estimate of the remaining time.

         2. Additionally, the Jobs Panel will share visibility into the estimated remaining time for acknowledged jobs.

         Previously, when uploading a file, actions could only be added to it after the file was uploaded (by calling a file update via a listener). Now, with our latest update, you can now include actions during file upload allowing actions to be applied to the file immediately upon creation.

        The find/replace operation is now able to handle large datasets. Now, records are batched into groups of 10,000 rows, and a unique versionId is assigned to each batch. Additionally, the workbook service will emit events for each batch processed.

        This improvement is particularly beneficial for @flatfile/plugin-record-hook, which can now retrieve and respond to all records in a single find/replace operation, thanks to the 10,000-row batching.

        When adding a secret to a space via the API, we have expanded the flexibility of secret names. While the API allows spaces within secret names, the UI previously restricted them by filtering spaces in the regex validation logic for Secret Names. With this update, space characters are now considered valid and accepted characters in secret names, aligning the behavior between the API and the UI.

         **Now Available: Accept Dynamic Inputs on Actions**

        ![image](../changelog/images/action_inputs.png)

        Now, when initiating an action, you have the option to gather additional information from end users to facilitate the successful completion of the intended task.

        **Here’s how it works:**

        Suppose you want to allow users to specify the name of the file they intend to export. In such cases, you can configure input fields for your action. When an end user triggers this action, a secondary dialog will appear, prompting them to provide the necessary information.

        **The available input types include:**

        - `string`: For capturing text-based information.
        - `textarea`: Ideal for longer text entries or descriptions.
        - `number`: To collect numeric data.
        - `boolean`: For simple yes/no or true/false responses.
        - `enum`: Enables users to select from a predefined list of options.

        **Two easy ways to get started:**

        - Learn about all the parameters available on `inputForm` for Actions [here](http://flatfile.com/docs/orchestration/actions#inputform).

        **Exciting Update: Additional Fields**

        ![image](../changelog/images/addl_fields.png)

        With additional fields, end users can seamlessly map to fields that don’t exist by simply adding a new property to any of your new or pre-existing Blueprint(s).

        Here’s how it works:
        - When you set allowAdditionalFields to true, your Sheet gains the ability to accept additional fields, extending beyond what’s originally specified in its configuration.
        - These extra fields can be incorporated, either through API integrations or by end users during the file import process.
        - Fields that go beyond the Blueprint’s initial setup are marked with a treatment property set to additional, ensuring complete transparency over what extends the Blueprint.
        - What’s more, adding a custom field is a breeze—its name will be automatically set to match the header name from the file being mapped. This simplifies the process.

        ![image](../changelog/images/event_logs.png)

        Our aim is to make it easy for everyone to monitor events, find problems, and help developers avoid overcomplicating their code with excessive Console logs that would need removal later.

        With our enhanced Event logs, you can now:

        1. View a comprehensive list of logged events, categorized by event topic.
        2. Easily discern the status of each event.
        3. Gauge the execution time of each event.
        4. Access events chronologically, with the most recent at the top.
        5. Dive into each event for context and review any associated console logs.

        As an added bonus, you have the capability to filter events, focusing solely on failures.

       Choosing a `namespace` on Space creation is now easier than ever. Rather than manually typing the namespaces into a free-form text field, you can simply choose from a dropdown menu of available options. The available namespaces are conveniently listed within the `namespaces` array of the Environment, providing a more efficient and accurate way to handle namespace selection.

        Previously, when using the find and replace feature, only the initial batch of records had data hooks run again. Now, the find/replace operation efficiently groups records into batches of 10,000 rows, assigning a unique versionId to each batch. This improvement empowers record-hooks to process all records seamlessly within a single find/replace operation.

        Previously, when adding a secret to a space through the API, we supported spaces in secret names. However, the UI had regex logic that filtered out spaces when validating secret names.

        In this update, we've harmonized the process by accepting space characters as valid characters for secret names in both the API and the UI. Your secret names can now include spaces without any issues.

        We've revamped the way partial replaces work, enhancing your data editing experience for maximum smoothness and intuitiveness. In the past, when you attempted to replace specific characters with an empty string (""), it occasionally resulted in the cell value becoming null, which wasn't quite what you had in mind.

        For instance, if you needed to eliminate dashes from UUID fields, you'd naturally want "abc-123" to transform into "abc123" rather than mysteriously turning null.

        We value your feedback. Now, you can confidently perform partial replacements without the hassle of unexpected null values.

        We've made improvements behind the scenes to ensure that your data gets mapped with more precision. Previously, some data could be missed during mapping, but now, we're considering both the option labels and values, making sure nothing is left behind. This means you'll have a smoother and more reliable experience when mapping your data, ensuring that everything is captured correctly.

      **New Job Outcome Acknowledgements**

      **`acknowledge: false`**

      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_modal.png)

      By default, job outcomes are reported through a toast notification in the top-right corner. To utilize this, simply set `outcome => message`. This approach ensures that your job completion status is promptly communicated to the end user.

      **`acknowledge: true`**

      ![image](../changelog/images/outcome_fullscreen.png)

      When the `acknowledge` option is configured as `true`, a persistent full-screen modal is presented. This modal remains visible until the user interacts by clicking the "Continue" button, acknowledging the outcome.

      **Usage**

      ```jsx
      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          acknowlege: true,
          message:
            "Text here.",
        },
      });
      ```

        **Enhanced Job Outcomes with Next Action Links**

      Job outcomes have been upgraded to support `next` action links. Now, you can display links to external URLs, Flatfile resources, or trigger downloads upon job completion.

      **Usage**
        <CodeGroup>
        ```jsx listener
        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            next: IdNext | WaitNext | UrlNext | DownloadNext,
            message:
              "Text here.",
          },
        });
        ```
        ```jsx Types
        type IdNext = {
          type: 'id' //link to a Flatfile resource
          id: string
        }

        type WaitNext = {
          type: 'wait' //only used in embedded Flatfile
        }

        type UrlNext = {
          type: 'url' //display a link to an external url
          url: string
          label: string
        }

        type DownloadNext = {
          type: 'download' // display and trigger a download
          url: string
          fileName: string
          label: string
        }
        ```

        **Enhanced Action Button Behavior**

        ![image](../changelog/images/hasAllValid.gif)

       Two key enhancements to Actions have been introduced:

        **Disable Actions When Invalid Records**: Developers can now add an optional flag to Actions, preventing users from initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records. This helps avoid unnecessary job failures and ensures Actions are performed on valid data.

        ```jsx
        constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }],
        ```

        **Disable Actions When No Selected Records:** To enhance the user experience, we've introduced the `hasSelection` flag. When added as a constraint, this flag disables Actions if no records are selected in the Sheet or Workbook, ensuring Actions are only triggered when relevant data is chosen.

         ```jsx
        constraints: [ { type: 'hasSelection' }],
        ```

    **Improved FFQL handling of dates and number comparisons**

      **Enhanced Number Field Queries:** When conducting equality or inequality FFQL comparisons for `number` fields, the query value is now cast to a number and then compared with the parsed "shadow" value. This rectifies issues related to numeric comparisons. Additionally, we've resolved a bug where numbers with no digits before the decimal point (e.g., ".3") were not being properly parsed into shadow values.

      **Advanced Date Field Handling:** For `date` fields, query values are now attempted to be parsed into dates. On the SQL side, a `CASE` statement is employed to parse the stored values into dates for accurate comparison. To accommodate SQL-side date parsing requirements, we've integrated a regex pattern to detect `YYYY-MM-DD`, `m/d/yy`, and `m/d/yyyy` formats. This ensures correct parsing and comparison of date values.

      **Fix for Invalid Number Input:** We've resolved a bug where changing a number field to an invalid number left the previous "shadow" value intact. Now, in such cases, the previous shadow value is properly cleared, leading to consistent and accurate behavior.

      These updates contribute to improved query handling, better data integrity, and a more seamless experience when working with number and date fields.

This enhancement provides users with clear and context-aware explanations for enabled Actions, contributing to an improved overall user experience.

      **🚀 Instant Extraction for CSV/TSV/PSV Files**

      We’re thrilled to introduce a significant enhancement to our import process. With the removal of the extraction step for CSV/TSV/PSV files, the import experience is now more seamless than ever. As soon as the upload is complete, these files are instantly extracted, ensuring an efficient and immediate handling of your data.

      The impact of this change is remarkable. What used to take approximately 3 and a half minutes to extract now concludes in less than 10 seconds.

      In addition, we now natively support TSV and PSV files meaning you don't need to use an extractor plugin to support these file types.

      While speed is the prime advantage, this upgrade doesn’t merely boost performance. It also simplifies and enhances reliability in our system. Previously, concerns about only a fraction of a file being extracted are now history. Furthermore, this approach strategically eases the load on our database, reducing the likelihood of encountering resource limits.

      In essence, it’s a win-win for both efficiency and user experience.

        The Sidebar now has three different states:
        - Collapsed state
        - Open state
        - Totally hidden state

        Additionally, the Sidebar will now automatically collapse itself on smaller screens.

        We now handle overflowing space name(s) by:
        - Breaking the word
        - Limiting the name to two lines and giving it an ellipsis if it overflows
        - Adding a tooltip with the space name to truncated names
        - Previously, badge names in the data checklist could break to two lines making them hard to read. This is also fixed.
