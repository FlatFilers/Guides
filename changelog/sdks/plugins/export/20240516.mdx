# Added option to export workbook without record messages

The `@flatfile/plugin-export-workbook` plugin version 5.1.0 introduces a new option that allows you to export workbook data without including record messages. This feature gives you more control over the exported data format.

## Usage

When configuring the export workbook plugin, you can now specify the `includeRecordMessages` option:

```javascript
import { exportWorkbookPlugin } from "@flatfile/plugin-export-workbook";

listener.use(
  exportWorkbookPlugin({
    includeRecordMessages: false, // Set to false to exclude record messages
    // other options...
  })
);
```

By default, `includeRecordMessages` is set to `true`, maintaining backward compatibility with previous versions.

## Benefits

This enhancement is particularly useful when:

- You want cleaner exports without validation messages
- You're exporting data to systems that don't need or can't process the message data
- You want to reduce the size of exported files

The option gives you more flexibility in controlling exactly what data is included in your workbook exports.
