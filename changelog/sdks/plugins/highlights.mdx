## June 2024 (1)

##### June 06, 2024

<div style={{ display: "table", width: "auto" }}>

  <div style={{ display: "table-row", width: "auto" }}>
    <Snippet file="chips/extractors.mdx" />
    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@1.0.0`

    <Snippet file="chips/core.mdx" />
    <div style={{ float: "left", display: "table-column", paddingLeft: "30px", width: "calc(80% - 30px)" }}>
      
      `@flatfile/plugin-job-handler@0.5.4`
      
      In this release, the @flatfile/plugin-job-handler package introduces improved error handling when the callback function returns an invalid job outcome.
      The package now gracefully handles errors thrown by the callback function, providing better resilience and reliability for developers using the package.
      Specifically, if the callback function throws an Error, the job is now automatically marked as failed, with the error message included in the job outcome.
      This enhancement ensures that developers receive clear feedback when issues arise during job processing, making it easier to debug and address any problems.
      With this improvement, the @flatfile/plugin-job-handler package offers a more robust and user-friendly experience for handling jobs and processing job outcomes.
      
      For example, if the callback function encounters an error like:
      
      ```typescript
      throw new Error('Failed to process job data');
      ```
      
      The package will automatically mark the job as failed with the provided error message:
      
      ```json
      {
        "info": "Failed to process job data",
        "outcome": {
          "acknowledge": true,
          "message": "Failed to process job data"
        }
      }
      ```

      `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.5.0`
      
      RecordHooks now include readonly configurations. This new feature gives you more control over how data is presented and modified in your application.
      Setting a record as readonly prevents any changes from being made, while marking individual fields as readonly allows editing for the remaining fields.
      To utilize this functionality, simply call the new setReadOnly() method on a record instance, optionally passing in field keys to specify which fields should be readonly.
      
      For example:
      
      ```js
      record.setReadOnly('age', 'name');
      ```
      
      This would make the 'age' and 'name' fields readonly for that record.
      This release enhances flexibility and strengthens data integrity, enabling you to build even more robust applications with Flatfile's powerful data management tools.

      `@flatfile/plugin-webhook-egress@1.2.3`
      
      The latest version introduces key improvements for enhanced functionality and user experience:
      
      **Switch to Fetch:** In this version, we’ve transitioned from using axios to fetch for HTTP requests, streamlining the library’s usage across different environments.
      Browser Compatibility: The plugin is now fully compatible with browser environments, extending its utility beyond server-side applications.
      
      **Enhanced Response Rejection Handling:** The integration of our response rejection utility allows for sophisticated post-webhook action decisions. Following a webhook egress, the utility analyzes the response to determine whether to delete records that were successfully submitted or to mark them with a status column reflecting their outcome. It also allows specifying custom error messages for fields within records that encountered rejections.
      
      This update aims to offer more flexibility, reliability, and broader applicability of the webhook egress plugin, ensuring seamless integration into your data workflow.

      `@flatfile/plugin-autocast@0.7.6`
      
      0.7.6 introduces string casting capabilities to the autocast plugin. With this new feature, numbers and booleans can now be automatically converted to strings, making it easier to manage data types across your applications.
      
      This enhancement is particularly useful in conjunction with the rawNumbers property found in `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor`, where numeric values extracted from documents can be seamlessly transformed into string fields for consistency and ease of use.

      `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@0.9.1` & `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@v1.11.3`
      
      New header logic has been added to the @flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor and @flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor. This update brings our extractors in line with Flatfile’s core header detection capabilities, offering three distinct header detection strategies: `default`, `explicitHeaders`, and `specificRows`.
      
      By employing the default strategy, the extractors now automatically scan the first 10 rows of your file to identify the header row based on the highest count of non-empty cells.

      `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@1.11.3`
      
      This release brings essential updates and improvements to enhance your experience with Excel file extractions:
      
      **File Size Detection:** The plugin now actively detects when a file is too large for extraction, guiding users to opt for CSV uploads for better handling.
      
      **Date Format Specification:** Introducing the dateNF parameter, enabling users to define specific date formats for Excel file parsing (e.g., yyyy-mm-dd), ensuring that dates are correctly recognized and formatted.
      
      **Handling Empty Sheets:** Previously, empty sheets within Excel files would result in errors. With this update, the plugin gracefully handles such cases by appropriately failing the job without causing unexpected errors.
      
      These improvements are aimed at providing a more robust, user-friendly experience for working with Excel files, ensuring data integrity and easing the extraction process.

      `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.1.11`
      
      In a recent update, we introduced a comparison mechanism to track changes between original and modified values, ensuring that records were only updated when both value and messages had changed. However, this approach unintentionally excluded updates to metadata when no changes were detected in value or messages.
      
      In this version, we've refined the process by comparing the entire original record object with the modified record object. This ensures that no updates, including metadata changes, are left unaccounted for, regardless of whether there were changes in the value or message fields. Your records are now more comprehensively managed and updated.

      `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.1.10`
      
      Previously, there was an issue with completing commits while using the `@flatfile/api` client-side, which led to the error message "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')." To address this problem, we've made a swift and effective transition to using fetch. Soon, we plan a more comprehensive solution.

      `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.1.9`
      
      - Previously, an issue arose when attempting to complete a commit with the `trackChanges` flag (a Workbook setting to disable actions on Sheet and Workbook when there is a commit that has not been completed) disabled on the Workbook. This issue has been resolved, and commits are now exclusively triggered when the `trackChanges` feature is enabled for the Workbook.
      
      - Additionally, we've implemented an advanced deep comparison method between the original record and the potentially modified record. This enhancement guarantees that only essential patches for updated records are transmitted, resulting in a notably more efficient and precise data update process.

      `@flatfile/plugin-extractor-xlsx@1.8.0`
      
      In this version, we've added a valuable enhancement to the Excel Extractor by exposing SheetJS's "raw" option. This option empowers users to preserve formatted text by default. When `raw` is set to true, the extractor will return the raw value, offering greater flexibility and control over extracted data.

      `@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.1.1`
      
      Previously, initiating the "import" process, whether by dropping a file into a sheet or clicking the "Import" button from a file, created an unintended secondary `workbook:map` job. This secondary job was detected by the automap plugin, leading to duplicate entries in a sheet.
      
      In this version, we've introduced a solution to address this issue. We've added an "isAutomap" flag to the job's input, which allows the automap plugin to filter jobs accordingly. If the "isAutomap" flag is not provided, the automap plugin will gracefully exit, ensuring a more streamlined and error-free workflow.

      `@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.1.1`
      
      Previously, when initiating the "import" process, which could be triggered by either dropping a file into a sheet or clicking the "Import" button from a file, a secondary `workbook:map` job was created. This unintentionally triggered the automap plugin, leading to duplicate entries within a sheet.
      
      In response to this issue, this version introduces an `isAutomap` flag within the job's input. The inclusion of this flag allows the automap plugin to apply appropriate filtering. If the flag is not provided, automap will gracefully exit without processing the job, thereby resolving the issue of duplicate entries in the sheet.

      `@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.1.0`
      
      Previously, the Automap plugin exclusively matched the `defaultTargetSheet` with the `sheet.name` or `sheet.id`. In this update, we have expanded the matching capability to include the `sheet.slug`. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and precision when configuring default target sheets within the Automap plugin. This improvement is especially beneficial when you need to pass something like the sheet name + filename dynamically, making the mapping process even more versatile.

      `@flatfile/util-extractor@0.4.5`
      
      `util-extractor` is a crucial dependency used in all extractor plugins. We've made an important fix on the import method across all extractor plugins. If you previously encountered the following error message, you can now resolve this issue by updating to the latest extractor version.

      **Major (Agent) Plugin-based Extraction Speed Improvements Just Went Live**
      
      We noticed the record insert portion of extraction taking far longer in plugins than in the core platform (with CSVs). We had to get to the bottom of why there was such a disparity and we’re thrilled to say we have a solution. **We’re seeing a 700k file that once took between 10-12 mins now only takes 1-1.5 min!**
      
      But wait, there’s more:
      
      Additionally, end users will now get updated percentages during the upload process and will receive a success message when the file is successfully extracted.
      
      Upgrade your extractor(s) to the latest to enjoy this optimization:
      
      - `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@1.7.5`
      - `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@0.7.3`

      ![image](../../../changelog/images/outcome_modal.png)
      
      Meet `@flatfile/util-response-rejection`, a new utility for showcasing rejected Records _from an external API_ to your customers. Managing rejected data during egress is vital for maintaining data accuracy, and this utility simplifies the entire process, ensuring a smoother experience for handling these instances.
      
      Here's what it does:
      
      1. Takes a `RejectionResponse` containing rejected Records and a rejection message.
      2. Locates the corresponding Record and adds the rejection message as an error to the Record cell.
      
      You can also utilize this utility directly with any listener.

      🚀 **Introducing `@flatfile/plugin-autocast`**
      
      Effortlessly transform data in your Sheets to align with the field types specified in the Blueprint.
      
      Supported field types:
      
      - **Numbers:** String numbers ('1'), string decimals ('1.1'), and string numbers with commas ('1,000') are interpreted as numbers.
      
      - **Booleans:**
      
        - Truthy values: '1', 'yes', 'true', 'on', ' ', 'y', and 1.
        - Falsy values: '- ', '0', 'no', 'false', 'off', ' ', 'n', 0, -1.
      
      - **Dates:** Date strings and numbers are cast to a UTC string (note: `YYYY-MM-DD...` is interpreted as an ISO 8601 date and is treated as treated as UTC, while other formats are treated as local time and converted to UTC).
        - '2023-08-16' => 'Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT'
        - '08-16-2023' => 'Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT'
        - '08/16/2023' => 'Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT'
        - 'Aug 16, 2023' => 'Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT'
        - 'August 16, 2023' => 'Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT'
        - '2023-08-16T00:00:00.000Z' => 'Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT'
        - 1692144000000 => 'Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT'
      
      Note: **@flatfile/plugin-record-hook** listens for the same event type (commit:created). Plugins will fire in the order they are placed in the listener.

      🚀 **Introducing `@flatfile/plugin-jobs-handler`**
      
      Our latest plugin, `@flatfile/plugin-jobs-handler`, streamlines handling Flatfile Jobs, which are a large unit of work performed asynchronously on a resource such as a file, Workbook, or Sheet.
      
      **Options at your fingertips:**
      
      - Update Job progress using `await tick(progress, message)`, returning a promise for `JobResponse`.
      - `opts.debug` Enable debug logging for the plugin
      
      To get started simplifying the management of your Jobs, explore the [README](../../../plugins-docs/core/job-handler).
      
    </div>

      🚀 **Introducing `@flatfile/plugin-space-configure`**
      
      Streamline the dynamic setup of new Flatfile Spaces with `@flatfile/plugin-space-configure`.
      
      **How it works:**
      
      - The `setup` parameter holds the Blueprint for the new Space.
      - And the `callback` parameter (invoked once the Space and Workbooks are fully configured) receives three arguments:
      
      1. `event`
      2. `workbookIds`
      3. Using the `@flatfile/plugin-jobs-handler` under the hood, the `tick` function can be used to update the Job’s progress.
      
      To simplify auto-configuring your Spaces, explore the [README](../../../plugins-docs/core/space-configure).

      **All extractors now support `chunkSize` and `parallel`**
      
      A new version of an underlying utility (`@flatfile/util-extractor`) introduces 2 new options for extracting records in all extractor plugins:
      
      - `chunkSize`: (Default: 3,000) Define how many records you want to process in each batch. This allows you to balance efficiency and resource utilization based on your specific use case.
      - `parallel`: (Default: 1) Choose whether the records should be processed in parallel. This enables you to optimize the execution time when dealing with large datasets.
      
      _Note: Previously, we were extracting with a chunkSize of 1,000._
      
      **Ex: Excel Usage: (See [docs](../../../plugins-docs/extractors/xlsx-extractor))**
      
      ```ts
      listener.use(ExcelExtractor({ chunkSize: 300, parallel: 2 }));
      ```
      
      If you update your extractor plugin to the latest, you will receive these new options.

      `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor`
      
      Now that the platform includes native support for TSV and PSV files, developers are no longer required to use a plugin specifically for these formats. As a result of this enhancement, the documentation for the `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor` has been revised to reflect this update.
      
      For users who are already utilizing or have integrated a plugin for TSV and PSV files, there's no need to worry about any disruptions. While the extraction will occur twice, resulting in a "extraction complete" status being displayed twice, the process remains functional and intact.

      `@flatfile/util-file-buffer@0.0.3`
      
      A fix was made to only run `fileBuffer` on uploaded files. This fixes an issue where extraction was occurring during export improperly.
      
      All extractor plugins went up one tick to leverage this update to the file buffer.
      
      <Info>
        The extractor most affected was `xlsx-extractor` as there’s a correlating
        plugin for exporting to xlsx.

      **🚀 Introducing `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor`**
      
      Introducing the latest addition to our extractor plugins: @flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor. Designed to streamline your data extraction tasks, this plugin is tailored to process delimited files including tab (\t), pipe (|), semicolon (;), colon (:), tilde (~), caret (^), and hash (#).
      
      Parameters and Options:
      
      - `fileExt` specifies the file name or extension to listen for, allowing you to define the file types to process.
      - `options.delimiter` the delimiter character used in the file.
      - `options.dynamicTyping` automatically convert numeric and boolean data in the file to their appropriate data types, ensuring accurate processing.
      - `options.skipEmptyLines`: With ‘true’, completely empty lines (evaluating to an empty string) will be skipped during parsing. With ‘greedy’, lines with only whitespace characters are also skipped.
      - `options.transform `define a function to be applied to each parsed value before dynamicTyping.
