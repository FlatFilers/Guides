## wrappers

`@flatfile/react@7.12.1`

This release updates the @flatfile/react package to version 7.12.1. The update
fixes a bug where the space was not completely reset upon closing the Flatfile
Portal. Specifically, the changes ensure that when the Flatfile Portal is
closed, the internal session space is reset, preventing any state from
persisting between sessions.

## wrappers

`@flatfile/javascript@1.4.1`

The startFlatfile function has been exported from the package, allowing
developers to invoke it directly. Additionally, the FlatfileClient type has been
exported from the @flatfile/api package, providing developers with access to
this type when using the @flatfile/javascript package.
