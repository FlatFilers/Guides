        `@flatfile/javascript@1.4.1`

        The release notes for version 1.4.1 of the @flatfile/javascript package include the following changes:

The startFlatfile function has been exported from the package, allowing developers to invoke it directly. This function was previously only accessible indirectly through the initializeFlatfile function. Additionally, the FlatfileClient type has been exported from the @flatfile/api package, providing developers with access to this type when using the @flatfile/javascript package.
