The release notes include a fix for a bug with the Workbook onSubmit functionality. Specifically, it addresses an issue where the onSubmit action was not being correctly added or updated in the workbook actions list. The fix ensures that the onSubmit action is properly added or updated when the onSubmit prop is provided, and that duplicates are not created if the action already exists. This change is relevant for developers using the Workbook component and expecting the onSubmit callback to be triggered when the workbook is submitted.
