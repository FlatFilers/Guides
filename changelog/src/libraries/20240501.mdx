## wrappers

`@flatfile/javascript@1.3.4`, `@flatfile/javascript@1.3.6`, `@flatfile/listener@1.0.4`, `@flatfile/react@7.9.3`

The `closeSpace.operation` and `closeSpace.onClose` properties are now optional, offering more flexibility. The `@flatfile/embedded-utils` dependency is updated to version 1.2.1, simplifying event listener setup with `handlePostMessage`.

`@flatfile/listener` now has optimized build tooling and updated dependencies, improving compatibility and performance.
