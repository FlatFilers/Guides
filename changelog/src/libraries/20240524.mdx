`@flatfile/react@7.9.9`

This release includes a fix to address instances where the iframe wasn't ready
when the `portal:initialize` call was posted. The fix ensures that the
`portal:initialize` message is sent to the iframe only after it has finished
loading. This resolves an issue where the initialization process could sometimes
fail due to the iframe not being ready. Developers using the `@flatfile/react`
package will benefit from a more reliable initialization process for the
embedded Flatfile experience.

The new `useIsIFrameLoaded` hook listens for the `load` event on the iframe and
updates a state variable accordingly. The `portal:initialize` message is then
sent only when the iframe has finished loading, ensuring a reliable
initialization process.
