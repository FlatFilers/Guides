        `@flatfile/react@7.12.0`

        This release includes the following changes:

A new `onClose` event handler has been added to the `useFlatfile` hook, allowing developers to handle when the Flatfile modal is closed. The `setOnClose` function can be used to set a callback function that will be invoked when the modal is closed. 

The missing stylesheet for the legacy `useSpace` and `usePortal` flows has been restored, ensuring proper styling for these deprecated hooks.

By default, the Flatfile modal now fills the entire screen. Developers may need to adjust any style overrides to accommodate this change.

Additionally, a bug that prevented server-side configuration of Spaces has been fixed.
