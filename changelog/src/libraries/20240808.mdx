        `@flatfile/react@7.12.0`

        This release includes the following changes:

A new `onClose` event handler has been added to the `useFlatfile` hook, allowing developers to specify a callback function that is called when the Flatfile modal is closed.

The missing stylesheet for the legacy `useSpace` and `usePortal` flows has been restored, ensuring proper styling for these deprecated hooks.

By default, the Flatfile modal now fills the entire screen. Developers may need to adjust any style overrides to accommodate this change.

Additionally, a bug that prevented server-side configuration of Spaces has been fixed.
