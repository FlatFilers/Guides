`flatfile@3.7.0`

The latest release of the flatfile package includes improvements for handling
file uploads and inferring event topics from arrays. Listeners using an array
syntax `listener.on(['commit:created', 'layer:created'], (event) => {}` will now
correctly infer the event topics.

This release also includes a fix for handling file uploads with updated event
`flatfile.upload`
