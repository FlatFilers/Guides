        `@flatfile/art@0.0.1`

        The changes include:

Two new art functions have been added: `printFlowerArt` and `printMusicArt`. The `printFlowerArt` function prints a flower design to the console. The `printMusicArt` function prints a musical design to the console and the quote "If music be the food of love play on!". Both new functions have been added to the `art` array, allowing them to be randomly selected and printed by the `callRandomArtFunction`. The `package.json` file has been updated with a new version `0.0.1`. The binary entry point in `package.json` has been changed to `./dist/index.mjs`. This package now provides three different ASCII art designs that can be randomly printed to the console when the `art` binary is executed.
