`@flatfile/javascript@1.3.8`

A bug fix for issues with the `closeSpace.onClose()` function. This function is
called when the Flatfile space is closed, and the bug fix ensures that it works
correctly.

An improvement to the closing behavior of the Flatfile space. Instead of
removing the iframe element immediately, a new `closeSpaceNow` function is
introduced, which handles removing the necessary elements and event listeners in
a more organized manner.

There is also an update to the way the confirmation modal is displayed when
closing the Flatfile space. Instead of using a separate event listener, the
closing logic is now handled within the existing `closeFlatfileSpace` function,
which listens for the `job:outcome-acknowledged` event and triggers the closing
process accordingly.
