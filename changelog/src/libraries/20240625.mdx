        A bug fix for issues with the `closeSpace.onClose()` function. This function is called when the Flatfile space is closed, and the bug fix ensures that it works correctly.

        The removal of the `findDefaultPage` import from the `@flatfile/embedded-utils` package, which is no longer used.

        A bug fix for an issue where the message event listener was not being properly removed when the Flatfile space was closed. The `removeEventListener` function was not being called correctly, and this fix ensures that the event listener is removed to avoid potential memory leaks.

        An improvement to the closing behavior of the Flatfile space. Instead of removing the iframe element immediately, a new `closeSpaceNow` function is introduced, which handles removing the necessary elements and event listeners in a more organized manner.

        There is also an update to the way the confirmation modal is displayed when closing the Flatfile space. Instead of using a separate event listener, the closing logic is now handled within the existing `closeFlatfileSpace` function, which listens for the `job:outcome-acknowledged` event and triggers the closing process accordingly.
