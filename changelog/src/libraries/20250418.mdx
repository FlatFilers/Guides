The Flatfile CLI v3.10.0 introduces a new `--ci` option for the `deploy` command that disables all interactive prompts, making it ideal for automated deployments in CI/CD pipelines. When using this flag:

- No confirmation prompts will be displayed
- The command will fail with a clear error message if multiple agents exist and no slug is provided
- TypeScript configuration checks will be skipped

This enhancement streamlines the deployment process in automated environments where user interaction isn't possible.
