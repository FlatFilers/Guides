## core

`@flatfile/api@1.5.21`

The response type for the `getRecordsAsCSV` endpoint was incorrectly typed as a string instead of a file. This fixes downloading a sheet as a CSV via SDk.

## core

`@flatfile/listener@0.3.15`

This version has four great updates:

- Previously, you had to fake-out TypeScript because the event time was not exposed (it was a private class variable) for FlatfileEvents. We have now added `createdAt` to the FlatfileEvent.
- Axios responses 200-399 now no longer throw Errors.
- Created a secrets cache based on `spaceId`.
- Previously, if your listener fetched secrets for multiple environments, those maps would entirely override each other.
- If your listener fetched `spaceId` overrides first, and then environment -- you would get the space id overrides.
- We now make sure that the fetch URL in the listener is formatted properly whether or not the user puts a trailing slash in the environment variable.

## core

`@flatfile/listener@0.3.14`

`event.secrets` now defaults to `spaceId`. It will throw if no `environmentId` is available for secrets retrieval.

## wrappers

`@flatfile/react@7.2.15`

You can now pass in a spacebody. This will allowyou to send more than any already-defined parameters allowed on space creation.

## wrappers

`@flatfile/react@7.2.14`

The close button and iframe now have a proper class name to allow for CSS overrides.
