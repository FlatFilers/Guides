        `flatfile@3.7.0`

        The latest release of the flatfile package includes improvements for handling file uploads and inferring event topics from arrays. Listeners using an array syntax `listener.on(['commit:created', 'layer:created'], (event) => {}` will now correctly infer the event topics. 
        
        This release also includes a fix for handling file uploads with updated event `flatfile.upload`
