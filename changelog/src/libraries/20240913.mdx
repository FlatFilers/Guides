@flatfile/javascript@1.4.2
The release includes the following updates:

The JavaScript Portal style sheet is now attached only once, instead of every time the Portal is opened. This should improve performance and avoid redundant style sheet insertions.

A new option has been added to allow specifying submit complete options, giving more control over the behavior when submitting a job. Developers can now set the 'acknowledge' and 'message' properties when completing a job submission.

The @flatfile/embedded-utils dependency has been updated to version 1.3.1.

Code examples:

To specify submit complete options:

```js
startFlatfile({
  // ...other options
  submitSettings: {
    complete: {
      acknowledge: false, // Don't acknowledge the submission
      message: 'Custom complete message'
    }
  }
})
```

This would result in the job being completed with 'acknowledge' set to false and 'message' set to 'Custom complete message'.
