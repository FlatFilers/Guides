`@flatfile/javascript@1.4.2`

The JavaScript Portal style sheet is now attached only once, instead of every time the Portal is opened. This should improve performance and avoid redundant style sheet insertions.

A new option has been added to allow specifying submit complete options, giving more control over the behavior when submitting a job. Developers can now set the 'acknowledge' and 'message' properties when completing a job submission.

This would result in the job being completed with 'acknowledge' set to false and 'message' set to 'Custom complete message'.
