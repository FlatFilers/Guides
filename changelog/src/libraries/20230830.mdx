      `@flatfile/react@7.2.18`

      This version introduces the following notable updates:

      - **Enhanced Close Dialog**: Class names have been incorporated for all elements within the close dialog, which becomes visible when closing the embedded Flatfile component. This improvement gives you more control on styling.

      - **Utilization of Shared Utilities**: The integration now utilizes the shared `@flatfile/embedded-utils` module. This change lays the groundwork for consistent properties to be shared across all Flatfile wrapper SDKs, promoting standardization and ease of maintenance.

      - **Dependency Refinement**: The dependencies on `vite` and `@flatfile/configure` have been removed. This streamlines the codebase and reduces unnecessary dependencies, contributing to a more efficient and lightweight integration.
