## wrappers

`@flatfile/javascript@0.1.13`

You can now use `@flatfile/api` inside a client-side listener without needing a
secret key. The listener will instead use the `accessToken` created from your
`publishableKey`.

## wrappers

`@flatfile/javascript@0.1.11` `@flatfile/react@7.2.21`

In this version, we've made two important updates:

1. We've changed the default setting for `sidebarConfig` to hide the sidebar,
   providing a cleaner and more focused workspace.
2. Now, when no `workbook` is set, `autoConfigure` is automatically turned on
   for Space creation. This enables you to listen for the `space:configure` job
   in a server side listener.

## core_plugin

`@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.1.2`

In this update, we've resolved a pesky bug that caused the message generated by
`recordHook` to be overwritten when `bulkRecordHook` was also in use.

Our solution? We've introduced caching, ensuring that both messages can coexist
harmoniously.
