`@flatfile/react@7.12.4`

Fixes a bug when relaunching a re-used space. Resolves an issue causing the "Maximum update depth exceeded" React error when multiple Portals are used within the same FlatfileProvider (this is not supported). 
Introduces changes to the FlatfileContext and FlatfileProvider components to handle the onClose callback, using a mutable ref instead of state. Refactors the resetSpace function and introduces changes to handle the resetOnClose config option when re-using a space.
