        A new printDinoArt function has been added that prints ASCII art of a dinosaur along with the message "All my friends are dead.". The printDinoArt function has been imported and added to the array of art functions. This means that when calling the callRandomArtFunction, it may now randomly print the dinosaur art along with the flower art or music art. The addition of the printDinoArt function provides a new artistic output option to consumers of this package.
