        The release includes the following changes:

A new ASCII art function `printDinoArt` has been added, which prints a dinosaur ASCII art along with the text "All my friends are dead.". The order of the console output for the `printDinoArt` function has been updated to print the ASCII art before the text. The `printDinoArt` function has been imported and added to the `art` array in the main package entry point. This allows the `callRandomArtFunction` to randomly print the new dinosaur ASCII art along with the existing flower and music ASCII arts.

To use the new `printDinoArt` function, developers can import it from the package and call it directly:

```typescript
import { printDinoArt } from 'package-name/art';

printDinoArt();
```

Alternatively, developers can use the `callRandomArtFunction` to randomly print one of the available ASCII arts, including the new dinosaur art:

```typescript
import { callRandomArtFunction } from 'package-name/art';

callRandomArtFunction();
```
