        `@flatfile/react@7.10.0`

          The FlatfileProvider component now accepts a new styleSheetOptions prop which allows setting the nonce value and position of the injected stylesheet. This gives more control over how the styles are applied.

          The package now contains utility functions attachStyleSheet and styleInject to dynamically inject the stylesheet into the DOM at runtime. This replaces the previous import of the stylesheet directly.

          The build process has been updated to no longer extract the CSS into a separate file, instead keeping it inlined in the JavaScript bundle.

          Several components that were previously importing the stylesheet have had those imports removed, relying on the new dynamic injection instead.

          Types have been added for importing SCSS files directly into TypeScript.
