`@flatfile/javascript@1.4.0`

This exciting release adds internationalization support to the Flatfile JavaScript SDK. The SDK now detects the user's browser language or allows specifying an override language.
Translation strings are provided for the confirmation modal, error modal, and other UI elements.
The SDK also includes functionality to handle missing translation keys and log them to the console.

Additionally, this release updates the modal logic to use functional components and make the text strings dynamic based on the provided translations or defaults.

A new util function `initializeIFrameConfirmationModal` is introduced to handle mounting the confirmation modal and its associated behaviors onto the iFrame wrapper element.
This function takes callbacks for the modal's button click actions (exit or stay) and text string providers for the modal's title, message, and button labels.
