        A new ASCII art function `printDinoArt` has been added that prints a dinosaur graphic and the text "All my friends are dead." The `printDinoArt` function has been imported and added to the `art` array, which is used to randomly call one of the art printing functions. This means that when `callRandomArtFunction` is invoked, there is now a chance that the dinosaur art will be printed along with the message.
