        A new printDinoArt function has been added which prints ASCII art of a dinosaur along with the text "All my friends are dead." The printDinoArt function has been imported and added to the art array, which means it can now be randomly selected and printed by the callRandomArtFunction. This adds a new piece of art that can be displayed to the consumer of the package.
