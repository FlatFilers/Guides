        `@flatfile/javascript@1.3.10`

        In this release, the Rollup configuration for building the @flatfile/javascript package has been updated to produce a UMD build. This change ensures that the package can be used in a broader range of environments, including browser-based applications and Node.js projects. The UMD (Universal Module Definition) format allows the package to be loaded as a module or as a global variable, providing flexibility for developers. Additionally, the configuration has been updated to handle CommonJS modules, resolve dependencies, and include support for built-in modules. The version number has been incremented to 1.3.10 to reflect this update.
