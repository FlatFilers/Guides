        The release also includes updates to the createlistener function, which now takes an additional onClose parameter. This function is used to handle the closing of the Flatfile space, and it removes the event listener and cleans up the DOM elements associated with the Flatfile space. The initializeIFrameConfirmationModal function has also been updated to use the new closeSpaceNow function, which simplifies the process of closing the Flatfile space.
