`@flatfile/javascript@1.3.9`

The createlistener function now takes an additional `onClose` parameter. This function is used to handle the closing of the Flatfile space, and it removes the event listener and cleans up the DOM elements associated with the Flatfile space. The `initializeIFrameConfirmationModal` function has also been updated to use the new `closeSpaceNow` function, which simplifies the process of closing the Flatfile space.
