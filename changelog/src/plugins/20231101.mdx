      - Previously, an issue arose when attempting to complete a commit with the `trackChanges` flag (a Workbook setting to disable actions on Sheet and Workbook when there is a commit that has not been completed) disabled on the Workbook. This issue has been resolved, and commits are now exclusively triggered when the `trackChanges` feature is enabled for the Workbook.

      - Additionally, we've implemented an advanced deep comparison method between the original record and the potentially modified record. This enhancement guarantees that only essential patches for updated records are transmitted, resulting in a notably more efficient and precise data update process.
