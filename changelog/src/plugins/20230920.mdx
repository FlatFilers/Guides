      `@flatfile/plugin-psv-extractor@1.6.0` & `@flatfile/plugin-tsv-extractor@1.5.0`

      We're excited to announce that PSV and TSV file types, previously reliant on plugins, are now natively supported by the Flatfile Platform! ðŸš€

      As part of this enhancement, we've marked these plugins as deprecated. Developers will receive a friendly console log notification, making it clear that these plugins are no longer needed. Enjoy the streamlined experience!
