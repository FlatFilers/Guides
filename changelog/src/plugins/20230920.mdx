## extractors

`@flatfile/plugin-psv-extractor@1.6.0` & `@flatfile/plugin-tsv-extractor@1.5.0`

We're excited to announce that PSV and TSV file types, previously reliant on
plugins, are now natively supported by the Flatfile Platform! 🚀

As part of this enhancement, we've marked these plugins as deprecated.
Developers will receive a friendly console log notification, making it clear
that these plugins are no longer needed. Enjoy the streamlined experience!
