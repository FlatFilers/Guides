## transform

`@flatfile/util-common@1.0.1`

This release replaces the `api.records.get` on @flatfile/api with a fetch to the
GET records endpoint. This significantly improves large response times.

## transform

`@flatfile/xlsx-extractor@1.11.2`

This update addresses an issue with how columns were managed when encountering
blank header columns. Previously, the last column was incorrectly removed in
such cases. Now, the column with the blank header is precisely identified and
removed, ensuring more accurate data representation and integrity in your
workflows.
