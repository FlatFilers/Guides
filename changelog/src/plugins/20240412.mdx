`@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@1.11.6`

This release enhances the xlsx extractor plugin with improved debug messaging and a new option for configuring header detection.
When running in debug mode, developers will now see helpful log messages indicating which sheet is being processed and what headers were detected.
Additionally, a new `headerDetectionOptions` option has been added to the `ExcelExtractorOptions` interface, allowing consumers to customize the algorithm used for detecting headers in their Excel files.
This gives users more control over how headers are identified, improving compatibility with different spreadsheet formats.
Overall, these changes provide better visibility into the extraction process and more flexibility for handling diverse Excel data sources.
