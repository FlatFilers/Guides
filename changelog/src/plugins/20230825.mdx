      Now that the platform includes native support for TSV and PSV files, developers are no longer required to use a plugin specifically for these formats. As a result of this enhancement, the documentation for the `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor` has been revised to reflect this update.

      For users who are already utilizing or have integrated a plugin for TSV and PSV files, there's no need to worry about any disruptions. While the extraction will occur twice, resulting in a "extraction complete" status being displayed twice, the process remains functional and intact.
