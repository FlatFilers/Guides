@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.6.0
This release removes the remeda dependency and adds the modern-async dependency. It also introduces a new option disableFileNameUpdate which disables updating the file name with automatic mapping information. The file name update behavior previously occurred unconditionally, but now can be controlled via this new option. There are no changes to the external interface beyond the addition of this new option.
