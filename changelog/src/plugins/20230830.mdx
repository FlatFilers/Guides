ðŸš€ **Introducing `@flatfile/plugin-jobs-handler`**

Our latest plugin, `@flatfile/plugin-jobs-handler`, streamlines handling Flatfile Jobs, which are a large unit of work performed asynchronously on a resource such as a file, Workbook, or Sheet.

**Options at your fingertips:**

- Update Job progress using `await tick(progress, message)`, returning a promise for `JobResponse`.
- `opts.debug` Enable debug logging for the plugin

To get started simplifying the management of your Jobs, explore the [README](../../../plugins-docs/core/job-handler).

ðŸš€ **Introducing `@flatfile/plugin-space-configure`**

Streamline the dynamic setup of new Flatfile Spaces with `@flatfile/plugin-space-configure`.

**How it works:**

- The `setup` parameter holds the Blueprint for the new Space.
- And the `callback` parameter (invoked once the Space and Workbooks are fully configured) receives three arguments:

1. `event`
2. `workbookIds`
3. Using the `@flatfile/plugin-jobs-handler` under the hood, the `tick` function can be used to update the Jobâ€™s progress.

To simplify auto-configuring your Spaces, explore the [README](../../../plugins-docs/core/space-configure).

## extractors

**All extractors now support `chunkSize` and `parallel`**

A new version of an underlying utility (`@flatfile/util-extractor`) introduces 2 new options for extracting records in all extractor plugins:

- `chunkSize`: (Default: 3,000) Define how many records you want to process in each batch. This allows you to balance efficiency and resource utilization based on your specific use case.
- `parallel`: (Default: 1) Choose whether the records should be processed in parallel. This enables you to optimize the execution time when dealing with large datasets.

_Note: Previously, we were extracting with a chunkSize of 1,000._

**Ex: Excel Usage: (See [docs](../../../plugins-docs/extractors/xlsx-extractor))**

```ts
listener.use(ExcelExtractor({ chunkSize: 300, parallel: 2 }));
```

If you update your extractor plugin to the latest, you will receive these new options.
