      @flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@0.9.1` & `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@v1.11.3`

      New header logic has been added to the @flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor and @flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor. This update brings our extractors in line with Flatfileâ€™s core header detection capabilities, offering three distinct header detection strategies: `default`, `explicitHeaders`, and `specificRows`.

      By employing the default strategy, the extractors now automatically scan the first 10 rows of your file to identify the header row based on the highest count of non-empty cells.

      [Discover more](../../../plugins-docs/extractors/xlsx-extractor) about these enhanced header detection options and how they can streamline your data import processes.
