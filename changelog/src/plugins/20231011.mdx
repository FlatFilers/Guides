`@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.1.1`

Previously, when initiating the "import" process, which could be triggered by either dropping a file into a sheet or clicking the "Import" button from a file, a secondary `workbook:map` job was created. This unintentionally triggered the automap plugin, leading to duplicate entries within a sheet.

In response to this issue, this version introduces an `isAutomap` flag within the job's input. The inclusion of this flag allows the automap plugin to apply appropriate filtering. If the flag is not provided, automap will gracefully exit without processing the job, thereby resolving the issue of duplicate entries in the sheet.
