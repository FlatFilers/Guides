    `@flatfile/util-file-buffer@0.0.3`

    A fix was madeÂ to only run `fileBuffer` on uploaded files. This fixes an issue where extraction was occurring during export improperly.

    AllÂ extractor plugins went up one tick to leverage this update to the file buffer.

    <Info>The extractor most affected was `xlsx-extractor` as thereâ€™s a correlating plugin for exporting to xlsx.</Info>
