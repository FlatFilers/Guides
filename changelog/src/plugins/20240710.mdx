        `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@3.0.0`

        A major change has been made where the 'required' field check from extractors and the subsequent `field.constraints.required` has been removed.
        This is a breaking change if you were using this required field check in your implementation.
        Source sheets no longer require the `field.constraints.required`.
        If you need to implement this functionality, you can use a listener to add the `field.constraints.required` to the specific fields you need.
