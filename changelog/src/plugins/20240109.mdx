      `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@1.11.3`

      This release brings essential updates and improvements to enhance your experience with Excel file extractions:

      **File Size Detection:** The plugin now actively detects when a file is too large for extraction, guiding users to opt for CSV uploads for better handling.

      **Date Format Specification:** Introducing the dateNF parameter, enabling users to define specific date formats for Excel file parsing (e.g., yyyy-mm-dd), ensuring that dates are correctly recognized and formatted.

      **Handling Empty Sheets:** Previously, empty sheets within Excel files would result in errors. With this update, the plugin gracefully handles such cases by appropriately failing the job without causing unexpected errors.

      These improvements are aimed at providing a more robust, user-friendly experience for working with Excel files, ensuring data integrity and easing the extraction process.
