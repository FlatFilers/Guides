`@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.1.11`

In a recent update, we introduced a comparison mechanism to track changes between original and modified values, ensuring that records were only updated when both value and messages had changed. However, this approach unintentionally excluded updates to metadata when no changes were detected in value or messages.

In this version, we've refined the process by comparing the entire original record object with the modified record object. This ensures that no updates, including metadata changes, are left unaccounted for, regardless of whether there were changes in the value or message fields. Your records are now more comprehensively managed and updated.
