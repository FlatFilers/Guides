      RecordHooks now include readonly configurations. This new feature gives you more control over how data is presented and modified in your application. 
      Setting a record as readonly prevents any changes from being made, while marking individual fields as readonly allows editing for the remaining fields. 
      To utilize this functionality, simply call the new setReadOnly() method on a record instance, optionally passing in field keys to specify which fields should be readonly. 

      For example: 
      ```js
      record.setReadOnly('age', 'name')
      ``` 
      This would make the 'age' and 'name' fields readonly for that record. 
      This release enhances flexibility and strengthens data integrity, enabling you to build even more robust applications with Flatfile's powerful data management tools.
