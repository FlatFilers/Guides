      `@flatfile/plugin-job-handler@0.5.4`

      In this release, the @flatfile/plugin-job-handler package introduces improved error handling when the callback function returns an invalid job outcome. 
      The package now gracefully handles errors thrown by the callback function, providing better resilience and reliability for developers using the package. 
      Specifically, if the callback function throws an Error, the job is now automatically marked as failed, with the error message included in the job outcome. 
      This enhancement ensures that developers receive clear feedback when issues arise during job processing, making it easier to debug and address any problems. 
      With this improvement, the @flatfile/plugin-job-handler package offers a more robust and user-friendly experience for handling jobs and processing job outcomes.

      For example, if the callback function encounters an error like:

      ```typescript
      throw new Error('Failed to process job data');
      ```

      The package will automatically mark the job as failed with the provided error message:

      ```json
      {
        "info": "Failed to process job data",
        "outcome": {
          "acknowledge": true,
          "message": "Failed to process job data"
        }
      }
      ```

      This release streamlines error handling, providing developers with a more seamless and reliable experience when working with the @flatfile/plugin-job-handler package.

      `@flatfile/plugin-dedupe@1.1.4`

      The latest release of the @flatfile/plugin-dedupe package introduces an improved error message when the dedupe plugin is incorrectly called from a workbook-level action instead of a sheet-level action.
      This helpful error message provides a clearer indication to developers using the package, guiding them to correctly configure the dedupe plugin as a sheet-level action.
