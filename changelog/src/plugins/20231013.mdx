`@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.1.1`

Previously, initiating the "import" process, whether by dropping a file into a
sheet or clicking the "Import" button from a file, created an unintended
secondary `workbook:map` job. This secondary job was detected by the automap
plugin, leading to duplicate entries in a sheet.

In this version, we've introduced a solution to address this issue. We've added
an "isAutomap" flag to the job's input, which allows the automap plugin to
filter jobs accordingly. If the "isAutomap" flag is not provided, the automap
plugin will gracefully exit, ensuring a more streamlined and error-free
workflow.
