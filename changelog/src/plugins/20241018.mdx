@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@2.2.3
This release fixes an async bug in the delimiter-extractor plugin. The parsing of basic and complex delimiter-separated files now produces equal results. A new option `skipEmptyLines` has been added to ignore empty lines when parsing, with a `'greedy'` value available. Unit tests have been enhanced to include separate commands for running unit tests and end-to-end tests. A new Jest configuration file has been added to configure test settings. The package version has been updated to 2.2.3.
