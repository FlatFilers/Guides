## extractors

`@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@1.0.0`
`@flatfile/plugin-xml-extractor@0.5.17` `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@2.0.0`
`@flatfile/plugin-json-extractor@0.7.6`

Extractor packages now include new features to support header selection.
Developers can enable header selection, allowing the plugin to automatically
detect and return letter headers (e.g. A, B, C) representing column indexes
instead of using the row data as headers. The release also includes dependency
updates and adds a new metadata property to the parser output containing
information about detected row headers when header selection is enabled.

This powerful new header selection capability streamlines working with
delimiter-separated data files lacking explicit column headers.
