`@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.1.0`

Previously, the Automap plugin exclusively matched the `defaultTargetSheet` with the `sheet.name` or `sheet.id`. In this update, we have expanded the matching capability to include the `sheet.slug`. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and precision when configuring default target sheets within the Automap plugin. This improvement is especially beneficial when you need to pass something like the sheet name + filename dynamically, making the mapping process even more versatile.
