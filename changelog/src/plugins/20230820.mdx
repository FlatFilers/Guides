**ðŸš€ Introducing `@flatfile/@flatfile/plugin-dedupe`**

@flatfile/plugin-dedupe adds a touch of magic by seamlessly removing duplicate records right within a sheet with several options to fit your use case:

- `opt.keep`: Decide whether to hang on to the first or last duplicate record.
- `opt.custom`: Craft your own dedupe function, for those out-of-the-box scenarios.
- `opt.debug`: Toggle on those helpful debug messages when youâ€™re in the lab.

Tech:

- Powered byÂ `ts-pattern`Â for in-depth Pattern Matching in TypeScript.
- Leverages the mightyÂ `remeda`Â for JavaScriptâ€™s functional programming and data wizardry.

## extractors

**ðŸš€ Introducing `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor`**

Introducing the latest addition to our extractor plugins:Â @flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor. Designed to streamline your data extraction tasks, this plugin is tailored to process delimited files including tab (\t), pipe (|), semicolon (;), colon (:), tilde (~), caret (^), and hash (#).

Parameters and Options:

- `fileExt`Â specifies the file name or extension to listen for, allowing you to define the file types to process.
- `options.delimiter`Â the delimiter character used in the file.
- `options.dynamicTyping`Â automatically convert numeric and boolean data in the file to their appropriate data types, ensuring accurate processing.
- `options.skipEmptyLines`: With â€˜trueâ€™, completely empty lines (evaluating to an empty string) will be skipped during parsing. With â€˜greedyâ€™, lines with only whitespace characters are also skipped.
- `options.transformÂ `define a function to be applied to each parsed value before dynamicTyping.
