      **Major (Agent) Plugin-based Extraction Speed Improvements Just Went Live**

      We noticed the record insert portion of extraction taking far longer in plugins than in the core platform (with CSVs). We had to get to the bottom of why there was such a disparity and we’re thrilled to say we have a solution. **We’re seeing a 700k file that once took between 10-12 mins now only takes 1-1.5 min!**

      But wait, there’s more:

      Additionally, end users will now get updated percentages during the upload process and will receive a success message when the file is successfully extracted.

      Upgrade your extractor(s) to the latest to enjoy this optimization:
      - `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@1.7.5`
      - `@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@0.7.3`
      - `@flatfile/plugin-json-extractor@0.6.4`
      - `@flatfile/plugin-pdf-extractor@0.0.5`
      - `@flatfile/plugin-xml-extractor@0.5.4`
      - `@flatfile/plugin-zip-extractor@0.3.7`
