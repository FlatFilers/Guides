@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.7.0
The release updates the @flatfile/plugin-automap package to version 0.7.0. The bundler for the package has been swapped from Parcel to tsup. The @flatfile/util-common dependency has been updated to version 1.5.0. The package now uses an ES module build with different entry points for Node.js and browser environments. The build scripts have been updated to use tsup instead of Parcel. Additional scripts for linting and checking have been added. The package.json file has been updated with the new build output paths and formats. The Jest configuration file has been renamed from jest.config.js to jest.config.cjs to support the ES module build. For developers using this package, the import paths may need to be updated based on the new module entry points.
