## extractors

`@flatfile/plugin-extractor-xlsx@1.8.0`

In this version, we've added a valuable enhancement to the Excel Extractor by exposing SheetJS's "raw" option. This option empowers users to preserve formatted text by default. When `raw` is set to true, the extractor will return the raw value, offering greater flexibility and control over extracted data.
