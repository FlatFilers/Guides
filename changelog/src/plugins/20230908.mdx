## extractors

`@flatfile/plugin-extractor-___`

All extractors have been fine-tuned to seamlessly handle extractions within a job, allowing the plugin more time to complete the extraction with less risk of the Agent timing out.

Additionally, we've resolved a bug that was causing extractions to falsely indicate completion when running in parallel, ensuring extraction truly finishes before signaling completion.

## transform

`@flatfile/plugin-autocast@0.2.2`

Dates that were cast to a UTC string using the autocast plugin were showing as invalid after transformation. A fix for this was added to version 0.2.2.
