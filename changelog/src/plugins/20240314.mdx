- Improved Error Handling: This release enhances the error management
  capabilities of the plugin, ensuring more robust and informative error
  responses during data extraction processes.

- Accurate File Status Updates: Upon successful job completion, the file status
  is now correctly updated, providing clear visibility and tracking of job
  outcomes.

- Enhanced Database Availability Checks: Recognizing the potential delays in
  database readiness, the plugin now includes polling mechanisms for database
  users. This ensures that operations proceed only when the restored database is
  fully available, enhancing the reliability of data interactions.
