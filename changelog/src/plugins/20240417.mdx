`@flatfile/plugin-graphql-schema@1.1.1`

This release enhances the @flatfile/plugin-graphql-schema package with a new
feature. The generateSheets function now allows filtering of GraphQL objects by
providing Sheet slugs. This improvement enables developers to have more granular
control over the mapping between GraphQL objects and Flatfile sheets, improving
flexibility and customization capabilities. For example, developers can now
specify which GraphQL objects should be included or excluded from the sheet
generation process based on their slugs:

```typescript
const sheetConfig = sheetConfigArray?.find(
  (config) => config.slug === object.name,
);

if (sheetConfigArray?.length > 0 && !sheetConfig) return;
```

With this update, the @flatfile/plugin-graphql-schema package becomes even more
powerful, offering developers a streamlined experience when working with GraphQL
schemas and Flatfile blueprints.
