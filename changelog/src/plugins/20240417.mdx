      `@flatfile/plugin-graphql-schema@1.1.1`

      This release enhances the @flatfile/plugin-graphql-schema package with a new feature.
      The generateSheets function now allows filtering of GraphQL objects by providing Sheet slugs.
      This improvement enables developers to have more granular control over the mapping between GraphQL objects and Flatfile sheets, improving flexibility and customization capabilities.
      For example, developers can now specify which GraphQL objects should be included or excluded from the sheet generation process based on their slugs:

      ```typescript
      const sheetConfig = sheetConfigArray?.find(
        (config) => config.slug === object.name
      )

      if (sheetConfigArray?.length > 0 && !sheetConfig) return
      ```

      With this update, the @flatfile/plugin-graphql-schema package becomes even more powerful, offering developers a streamlined experience when working with GraphQL schemas and Flatfile blueprints.
