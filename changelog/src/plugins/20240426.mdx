      `@flatfile/plugin-space-configure@0.5.0`

      In this release of the @flatfile/plugin-space-configure package, we've added a feature that allows you to maintain the order of workbooks in the Space UI sidebar. 
      This means you can now control the order in which your workbooks appear, providing a more intuitive and customized experience for your users. 
      To enable this functionality, simply include the `maintainWorkbookOrder` option set to `true` when configuring your space. 
      The workbook order will then be preserved based on the order in which the workbooks are created. 
      This enhancement gives you greater control over the Space UI, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs and provide a seamless user experience.
