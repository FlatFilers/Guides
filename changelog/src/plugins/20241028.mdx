## schema

@flatfile/plugin-convert-openapi-schema@0.3.2 Updated the plugin to version
0.3.2. This release fixes an async/await bug in the plugin. The plugin now
properly handles asynchronous operations related to configuring the space with
OpenAPI schema. The changes include updating the index.ts file to use the
configureSpace function correctly and removing unnecessary code. The
setup.factory.ts file was refactored to handle undefined data more gracefully
when generating fields.

@flatfile/plugin-convert-yaml-schema@0.3.2 This release includes an important
bug fix and updates several dependencies. The async/await bug in the plugin has
been resolved. Additionally, the dependency on
@flatfile/plugin-convert-json-schema has been updated to version 0.4.2. The
package.json file has been updated with new script commands for running
different types of tests (unit, e2e). The plugin's entry point (index.ts) has
been refactored to simplify the configureSpaceWithYamlSchema function, which now
uses the configureSpace function from the @flatfile/plugin-space-configure
package. The setup.factory.ts file has been updated to return a Setup object
instead of a SetupFactory, and the generateSetup function now handles schema
processing and field generation more efficiently.

@flatfile/plugin-convert-sql-ddl@0.2.2 This release updates the
@flatfile/plugin-convert-sql-ddl package to version 0.2.2. It includes a fix for
an async/await bug. The configureSpaceWithSqlDDL function has been refactored to
use the configureSpace function from @flatfile/plugin-space-configure,
simplifying the implementation. The generateSetup function has been updated to
remove the source property from the workbook object and return a Setup type
instead of a SetupFactory type.

@flatfile/plugin-convert-json-schema@0.4.2 This release fixes an async/await bug
in the plugin. Additionally the generateSetup function has been refactored to
handle cases where the data or data.properties is undefined, and the
partialSheetConfig.source property is no longer deleted.
