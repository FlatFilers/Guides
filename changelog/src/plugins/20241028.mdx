@flatfile/plugin-convert-sql-ddl@0.2.2
This release updates the @flatfile/plugin-convert-sql-ddl package to version 0.2.2. It includes a fix for an async/await bug. The configureSpaceWithSqlDDL function has been refactored to use the configureSpace function from @flatfile/plugin-space-configure, simplifying the implementation. The generateSetup function has been updated to remove the source property from the workbook object and return a Setup type instead of a SetupFactory type.
