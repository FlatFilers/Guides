@flatfile/plugin-convert-yaml-schema@0.3.2
This release includes an important bug fix and updates several dependencies. The async/await bug in the plugin has been resolved. Additionally, the dependency on @flatfile/plugin-convert-json-schema has been updated to version 0.4.2. The package.json file has been updated with new script commands for running different types of tests (unit, e2e). The plugin's entry point (index.ts) has been refactored to simplify the configureSpaceWithYamlSchema function, which now uses the configureSpace function from the @flatfile/plugin-space-configure package. The setup.factory.ts file has been updated to return a Setup object instead of a SetupFactory, and the generateSetup function now handles schema processing and field generation more efficiently.
