The `viewMapped` functionality has been updated to include new text strings for
messaging related to updating a table to only view mapped fields. The messages
include "Updating the table to only view mapped fields", "Halfway there, hang
tight...", "Almost done...", "Table update complete. Please audit the data", and
"An error occurred while updating the workbook. See Event Logs." These strings
will be displayed to the user during the process of updating a table to show
only mapped fields, providing status updates and handling potential errors. This
change enhances the user experience by providing clear communication during this
operation.
