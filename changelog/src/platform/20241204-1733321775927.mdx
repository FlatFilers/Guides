The release notes include updates to the plugin's viewMapped functionality. New text strings have been added for messaging related to updating a table to only view mapped fields. The messages include "Updating the table to only view mapped fields", "Halfway there, hang tight...", "Almost done...", "Table update complete. Please audit the data", and "An error occured while updating the workbook. See Event Logs." These strings will be displayed to the user during the process of updating a table to show only mapped fields, providing status updates and handling potential errors. This change enhances the user experience by providing clear communication during this operation.
