        **We’ve added Portuguese (Brazilian) translations!**

        Building upon our existing language support (based on your customers’ browser locale), which already included French, German, and Spanish translations, we’ve expanded our capabilities to cater to an even broader audience.

        Need another language? Let us know and we’ll prioritize getting it added.
