# Delete and Download Record Actions for Advanced Filters

We've enhanced our advanced filtering capabilities by adding a new "RowSelectionTools" bar that appears when rows are selected in a Sheet with `advancedFilters` enabled.

## Key Features

- **Row Selection Indicator**: Displays the count of currently selected rows
- **Delete Action**: Quickly remove selected rows from your sheet
- **Download Action**: Export only the selected rows to a CSV file

## How It Works

When `advancedFilters` are enabled and rows are selected in a sheet, a toolbar appears at the bottom of the screen showing how many rows are selected and providing quick access to delete and download actions.

These actions use the existing `delete` and `download` bulk row actions, maintaining the same workflow with modal confirmations and toast notifications on completion to ensure consistency with the current user experience.

This enhancement makes it easier to work with filtered subsets of your data, allowing for more efficient data cleaning and management workflows.
