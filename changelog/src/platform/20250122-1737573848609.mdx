Added a new thread_id column to the Snapshot model that can optionally store a thread identifier string.

The createSnapshot method now accepts an optional threadId parameter, and stores it in the new thread_id column when provided.

The listSnapshots method now accepts an optional threadId parameter, and will filter the returned snapshots to only those with a matching thread_id when provided.

This allows grouping snapshots by a thread identifier, which could be useful for applications that need to manage snapshots within distinct conversation threads or similar contexts.

For example, to create a snapshot associated with a thread:

```typescript
const snapshot = await workbooksService.createSnapshot({
  sheetId: 'sheet123', 
  label: 'Initial state',
  threadId: 'conversationThread456'
});
```

And to retrieve only the snapshots for a given thread:

```typescript
const threadSnapshots = await workbooksService.listSnapshots({
  sheetId: 'sheet123',
  threadId: 'conversationThread456'
});
```
