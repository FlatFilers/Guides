The release notes summarize the following changes:

The UpdateResolutionsLogic class has been updated to use the `clipId` property instead of the `dataClipId` property when accessing the job configuration object. This change affects the internal logic for updating data clip resolutions.

The `getClipResolutions` method in the DataClipsService class has been simplified. It no longer emits a `DataClipResolutionsUpdated` event after fetching the clip resolutions. This change affects the behavior of fetching clip resolutions, but the method signature and parameters remain the same.
