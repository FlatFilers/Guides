The following updates have been made to the translation files:

In the "promptBar" section, a new key "fieldTooltip" with a value of "{{key}}: {{description}}" has been added for English, French, and English regional variants. This likely provides a tooltip for displaying field descriptions.

In the "nativeActions" section, a new subsection has been added with three keys: "addColumn", "clearColumn", and "removeColumn" with their respective translations for adding, clearing, and removing columns. This suggests new functionality for managing columns in the interface.

In the English translation file, the title of the "mapValues" section has been updated from "Map values" to "Map Fields".

In the English translation file, the keys for "addColumn", "clearColumn", and "removeColumn" have been moved from the root level to the new "nativeActions" section.

These changes indicate updates to the user interface for managing fields and columns, including the ability to add, clear, and remove columns, as well as providing field description tooltips. Developers using this package should be aware of these new or updated features.
