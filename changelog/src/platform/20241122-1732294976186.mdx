The following changes have been made to the package:

1. Removed the `flatfileIsString`, `flatfileIsNumber`, `flatfileIsBoolean`, and `flatfileIsDate` constraints from the built-in constraints list.

2. Removed the `isString`, `isNumber`, `isBoolean`, and `isDate` utility functions and their corresponding test files.

3. Updated the `TYPE_CONSTRAINT_MAP` in `utils.ts` to use `flatfileIsValidNumRange`, `flatfileIsValidDateRange`, and `flatfileMapsToBoolean` instead of the removed constraints.

4. Modified the `isValidCity` constraint to only check if the city is found in the specified country, instead of checking for the state/province as well. The default country code is now 'US' if not provided.

5. Modified the `isValidCountry` constraint to use a simpler approach for validating country names and codes.

6. Removed the requirement of checking for empty values in several constraints, as the updated constraints now handle null, undefined, and empty values gracefully.

7. Updated the `isValidDateRange` constraint to handle relative date formats like 'now', 'today', 'tomorrow', and 'yesterday', as well as custom error messages.

8. Updated the `isValidLength` constraint to handle invalid min/max value configurations and provide a default error message.

9. Updated the `isValidNumRange` constraint to handle non-finite values and provide a default error message.

10. Updated the `isValidPhoneNumber` constraint to handle non-string inputs gracefully.

11. Updated the `isValidRegex` constraint to provide a default error message.

12. Updated the `isValidStateProvince` constraint to use the default 'US' country code if not provided and handle error messages gracefully.

13. Updated the `isValidUrl` constraint to handle null, undefined, and empty values gracefully.

14. Updated the `isValidUSPhoneNumber` constraint to handle non-string inputs gracefully.

The main changes involve removing the built-in type validation constraints (`isString`, `isNumber`, `isBoolean`, `isDate`) and updating the remaining constraints to handle null, undefined, and empty values consistently. Additionally, some constraints have been simplified or updated to provide better error handling and default error messages.

Overall, these changes aim to streamline the built-in constraints, improve error handling, and provide more consistent behavior across different constraints.
