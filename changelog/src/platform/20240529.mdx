`spaces-ui`

A new "Update View" button can now be found in the job outcome modal for jobs that modify the visibility of columns in a workbook sheet. This button triggers updating the column visibility based on the job outcome.

There are 2 new capabilities to the next property of Job Outcomes:

- `view` gives developers the ability to manipulate the Sheet's view on completion of a Job - Giving control over things like applying a filter or hiding a column
- `download` gives developers the ability to include file details (such as a fileName and URL), which are then used to trigger a download to the user's browser on completion of the job
