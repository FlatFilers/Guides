`spaces-ui`

A new "Update View" button can now be found in the job outcome modal for jobs
that modify the visibility of columns in a workbook sheet. This button triggers
updating the column visibility based on the job outcome.

There are 2 new capabilities to the next property of Job Outcomes:

- `view` gives developers the ability to manipulate the Sheet's view on
  completion of a Job - Giving control over things like applying a filter or
  hiding a column
- `download` gives developers the ability to include file details (such as a
  fileName and URL), which are then used to trigger a download to the user's
  browser on completion of the job
