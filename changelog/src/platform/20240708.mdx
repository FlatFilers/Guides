        The release notes for these changes are:

        More control over the jobs has been included via a new 'excludeChildJobs' option in the ListJobsRequest. When set to true, only top-level jobs will be returned unless a parentId is specified. 

        A new property 'detectedHeaderRow' has been added to the FileJobConfig type. This property indicates the row number of the header row detected during file extraction.

        The BaseProperty type now includes an 'actions' property, which is an array of actions that end users can perform on a Column.

        For composite unique constraints in sheet schemas, a new 'requiredFields' property has been added. This property specifies fields that, when empty, will cause the unique constraint to be ignored.

        A new ListUsersSortField enum has been added, which defines the fields that users can be sorted by when listing them.

        A new resendInvite method has been added to the Users client, allowing resending an invitation to a user for the account.
