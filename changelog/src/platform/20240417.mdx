**Enhanced Workbook Build Process and Diagnostic Logging**

**Extended Wait Time for Workbook Readiness**:

To accommodate more complex data processing needs, we have extended the maximum wait time for workbook readiness from 30 to 120 seconds. This adjustment ensures that larger or more complex workbooks have sufficient time to complete their build process without interruption.

**Added Timeout Functionality**:

We've introduced a new timeout feature that automatically stops the workbook building process if it exceeds the allotted time. This prevents prolonged waits and potential system overloads, improving overall system reliability.

**Improved Logging Capabilities**:

To aid in troubleshooting and optimize workbook build performance, we have enhanced our logging system. Logs now include additional context information, offering deeper insights into the workbook building process and helping identify and resolve issues more efficiently.
