The getDataDiff function has been updated to handle array values correctly when comparing proposed changes with existing source (src) and artifact data.

If the proposed array value is the same as the existing array value in either the source or artifacts, it will not be included in the changeset returned by getDataDiff.

The function now uses the lodash isEqual utility to compare array values, instead of strict equality (===), to account for differences in order or reference of array elements.

For example, if the proposed tags array is ['jedi', 'sith'], it will not be included in the changeset if the existing source tags are ['JEDI', 'SITH'] or if the existing artifact tags are ['jedi', 'sith'], because the values are considered equal despite differences in capitalization or array order.

This change ensures that unnecessary changes are not included in the changeset when working with array values, reducing noise and improving the accuracy of the changeset calculation.
