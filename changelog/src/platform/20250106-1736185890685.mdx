The FileUploadButton component now accepts a new prop called fullWidth. When set to true, this prop will make the FileUploadButton component span the full width of its container.

In the SheetViewEmptyStates component, the FileUploadButton is now rendered with the fullWidth prop set to true, making it span the full width of its container.

Additionally, a new Button component is rendered with the fullWidth prop set to true, making it span the full width of its container as well. This is likely intended for a manual entry button or similar action.
