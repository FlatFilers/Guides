        Introducing support for finding empty fields in ffql using the syntax:

        ```jsx
        filter: first_name eq ""
        ```

        Now, you can easily query and filter records with empty values.

       Resolved an issue where the import button could prematurely appear before a file was ready to be imported. This was due to an early update of the file's status with a workbook ID, which has now been adjusted to wait until the data is queriable before updating. The import process now aligns better with the file's readiness.
