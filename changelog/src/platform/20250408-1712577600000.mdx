**Improved Data Clips Collaborator Experience**

We've enhanced the user experience in Data Clips by hiding the collaborator input when no space guests exist:

- The collaborator input is now automatically hidden in the Data Clip create modal when there are no space guests
- Similarly, the collaborator section is hidden in the share modal when no guests are available
- This provides a cleaner interface by only showing relevant options based on the current space context

This improvement streamlines the Data Clips creation and sharing workflow by removing unnecessary UI elements when they're not applicable.
