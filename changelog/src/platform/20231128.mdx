      **Introducing New Endpoint for Workbook Commit Retrieval**

      We're excited to announce the addition of the new GET `/workbooks/{workbookId}/commits` endpoint. This improvement streamlines the process of retrieving all commits associated with a specific workbook, offering a more efficient way to determine the completion status of all processing activities on that workbook.

      While this enhancement primarily benefits the Flatfile UI, the endpoint is fully exposed, making it a valuable tool for developers looking to optimize commit retrieval and processing status checks in their own applications.

      [See the endpoint](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/workbooks/get-commits-for-a-workbook)

      We've successfully addressed and fixed the issue related to extracting/uploading files with special characters in their names. If you previously encountered difficulties with such files, this update resolves those challenges, ensuring smoother and more reliable file handling going forward.

      **Improved Handling of Long-Running Jobs with New Timeout Feature**

      ![image](../changelog/images/job_failure.png)

      To enhance clarity and efficiency in job processing, we’ve implemented an update for managing long-running jobs. Previously, jobs that weren’t acknowledged within 5 minutes would silently fail due to a timeout by the agent, leading to confusion as these jobs never reached completion (They were left in an executing state).

      To address this, we’ve now added a routine check that occurs every 5 minutes. This check will automatically fail jobs that are still executing but haven’t been [acknowledged](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/jobs/acknowledge-a-job) (ack’d) within this timeframe. This update ensures better transparency and control in the job execution process, reducing confusion and streamlining operations.
