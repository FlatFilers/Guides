Added a stop function to the chat assistant component to allow stopping the AI response generation. The stop function and loading state are now passed as props to the chat input component.

Modified the summary view to filter out workbooks labeled as "file" from being displayed. The expanded items state is now initialized based on the filtered workbooks list, excluding file workbooks.

These changes provide the ability to stop AI response generation on demand and improve the summary view by excluding file workbooks from being displayed and expanded by default.

Example usage for stopping AI response generation:

```jsx
<ChatInput
  {...{
    stop,
    isLoading,
    // other props
  }}
/>
```
