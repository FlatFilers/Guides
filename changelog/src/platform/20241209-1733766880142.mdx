The release notes include the following updates:

A new first-time login modal has been added to the dashboard, prompting the user to select their role from a list of options. The modal will display the text "Which of these best describes you?" and provide an option for "I'm a frontend developer looking to embed an importer in my app". When this option is selected, the user will proceed to the main dashboard interface.

To illustrate the changes, the e2e tests have been updated to include the following steps:

1. Wait for the "Which of these best describes you?" modal to appear within a 10-second timeout.
2. Click the "I'm a frontend developer looking to embed an importer in my app" option to proceed.

This change affects the initial onboarding experience for new users, allowing them to self-identify their role and receive a tailored experience within the dashboard application.
