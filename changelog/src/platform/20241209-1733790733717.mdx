This release includes updates related to data clip collaborators:

The DataClipCreated event handler now sends invitations to all collaborators added to a new data clip. The AuthService is used to fetch user details and send guest or user invitations accordingly.

A new DataClipCollaboratorUpdated event is introduced to handle collaborator updates for existing data clips. When collaborators are added or removed from a data clip, this event is emitted and the corresponding handler sends invitations to the new collaborators.

In the DataClipsService, when updating a data clip, the existing and new collaborators are identified, and only the new collaborators receive invitations.

Error handling has been improved in the event handlers to log appropriate error messages when collaborator data is missing or a data clip is not found.

These changes streamline the process of sending collaborator invitations when creating or updating data clips, ensuring that all new collaborators receive the necessary invitations promptly. Developers using the package can expect collaborators to receive timely invitations when added to data clips.
