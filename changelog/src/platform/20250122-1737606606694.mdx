The release notes include the following changes:

The `MappingsRepository.getRules` method has been updated to improve performance when querying for mapping rules with large source or destination key sizes. Instead of joining the mapping programs and rules in a single query, it now fetches the programs and rules separately and associates them after the fact. This avoids issues with deserializing large JSON objects.

The method now accepts combinations of source and destination key filters (e.g. `someOfTheseSourceKeys` and `someOfTheseDestinationKeys`) and constructs the appropriate query conditions. It supports both the current and legacy key formats.

The `MappingsService.buildMapping` method has been updated to remove the legacy key normalization step for backwards compatibility. This change removes the creation of duplicate field mappings using the legacy normalized key format.
