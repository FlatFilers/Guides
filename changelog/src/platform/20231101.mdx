**Enhanced Cell Copying with Multi-line Preservation**

We've improved the functionality for copying cells from external spreadsheets into our system. Now, when you copy cells containing more than one line, these new lines are preserved in the cell value upon pasting.

While these additional lines may not be visually apparent in the table, you can verify their presence by inspecting the data through the API, or by copying and pasting the cell content into another application.

This update ensures better data integrity and consistency when transferring content with complex formatting.
