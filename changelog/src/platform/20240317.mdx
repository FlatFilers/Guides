**Refined AI Mapping Precision**

We’ve fine-tuned the interplay between AI-generated mapping suggestions and
user-defined mapping history to enhance accuracy and user trust in our system.
Previously, AI recommendations marked as “very confident” could override
mappings with a user history score greater than 0.99. To address this, we’ve now
implemented a cap on AI mapping scores, ensuring they do not exceed 0.99. This
change guarantees that high-confidence user history takes precedence, fostering
a more reliable and user-centric mapping experience.
