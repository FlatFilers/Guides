       **Refined AI Mapping Precision**

        We’ve fine-tuned the interplay between AI-generated mapping suggestions and user-defined mapping history to enhance accuracy and user trust in our system. Previously, AI recommendations marked as “very confident” could override mappings with a user history score greater than 0.99. To address this, we’ve now implemented a cap on AI mapping scores, ensuring they do not exceed 0.99. This change guarantees that high-confidence user history takes precedence, fostering a more reliable and user-centric mapping experience.
