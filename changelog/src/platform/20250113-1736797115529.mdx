The release notes include an update to the SheetContent component in the WorkbookApp. The change modifies the CSS classes applied to the outer div element of the component. Specifically, it adds the 'overflow-hidden' class to ensure any content that exceeds the component's boundaries is clipped and not visible. This update enhances the visual appearance and behavior of the SheetContent component, preventing potential layout issues caused by overflowing content.
