## Enhanced Data Clip Sharing with Guest Links

We've improved the sharing capabilities for Data Clips by replacing the previous `guestAuthentication` array with a dedicated `guestLinkUrl` field. This change simplifies the process of sharing Data Clips with external collaborators.

### What's Changed

- Replaced the `guestAuthentication` field with a new `guestLinkUrl` field in the Data Clips database schema
- Added support for generating and managing secure guest links for Data Clips
- Updated the Data Clips UI to include a "Share" button for copying guest links
- Enhanced security and access control for shared Data Clips

### Benefits

- **Simplified Sharing**: One-click generation of shareable links for Data Clips
- **Improved Security**: Better control over access to shared Data Clips
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Easier to share specific data segments with external collaborators
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Reduced friction when collaborating on data validation and transformation

This update makes it easier to collaborate on data subsets while maintaining security and control over your data.
