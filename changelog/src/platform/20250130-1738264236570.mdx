The release notes include the following updates:

The AddExtractorTask has been removed from the AssistantModule. This task was previously used to add an extractor agent (e.g. xlsx-extractor, json-extractor, xml-extractor) to a given space. The corresponding unit tests, types, and implementation files for this task have also been deleted.

The /tools/add-extractor API endpoint in the BFFController has been removed. This endpoint was previously used to trigger the AddExtractorTask for adding an extractor agent.

The AIRunToolLogic logic for running jobs has been updated to remove the handling of the 'addExtractor' job config type. This job config type was previously used to run the AddExtractorTask.

As a result of these changes, the functionality to automatically add extractor agents to a space has been removed from the platform. Developers using the platform will no longer have access to this functionality through the API or other means.
