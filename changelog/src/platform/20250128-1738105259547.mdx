The release notes contain the following updates:

A new API endpoint has been added to retrieve the message history for a given space. This endpoint is accessed via a GET request to `/spaces/:spaceId/messages/history` and requires the `space:read` privilege. It returns a `PubNubMessageHistoryResponse` object containing the message history for the specified space.

Example usage:

```typescript
const response = await httpClient.get<Flatfile.spaces.PubNubMessageHistoryResponse>(`/spaces/${spaceId}/messages/history`);
```

The `PubNubPublisher` class now includes a `fetchMessages` method that allows retrieving messages from the PubNub service. It takes an object with `channels` and `start` parameters, where `channels` is an array of channel names and `start` is a timestamp representing the start time for fetching messages.

A new dependency `@types/pubnub` has been added to the project, likely for better type support for the PubNub library.
