Improvements have been made to error handling and user feedback in the file import and mapping process. If an error occurs, a popover is displayed to the user with the error message, providing clearer feedback on failures during the import process.

Additionally, in the FileUploadRedirectContext, a similar useEffect hook has been introduced to display a popover with any error messages from the mapToSheetObservable. This provides feedback to the user when errors occur during the mapping of a file to a sheet.
