The changes include updates to test cases and formatting fixes by adding trailing commas.

In the test cases for presenters and workbooks, trailing commas were added to object literals to improve code readability and consistency.

For example, in the presenters.spec.ts file, trailing commas were added to the expected object literals used for assertions:

```
{
  readonly: undefined,
}
```

Similarly, in the workbooks.e2e-spec.ts and workbooks.service.spec.ts files, trailing commas were added to the expected object literals used for assertions:

```
{
  updatedAt: expect.any(String),
}
```

These changes do not affect the external interface or functionality of the package, but rather improve the internal code quality and consistency by following best practices for object literal formatting.
