The description for the 'autobuild' app option has been updated to remove the exclamation mark and make the wording more concise. Instead of "You tell us what you want, we build it for you! It's really that easy!", the new description reads "You tell us what you want, we build it for you. It's that easy." This change provides a more straightforward description of the Autobuild feature without the extraneous exclamation mark.
