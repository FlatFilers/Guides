The release notes detail the following updates:

The mapping service now correctly handles source fields that are all uppercase. Previously, uppercase fields in the source sheet would not match destination source data fields. Now, the service automatically matches uppercase source field names to their lowercase or alternate name equivalents in the destination data. This improves the accuracy of field mapping between source and destination sheets when the source has uppercase field names.
