The release notes summarize the following changes:

Modified the SQL query to handle cases where the main value is initially null and the clip value diverges from the snapshot value. The new logic identifies if the main value is null and the clip value differs from the snapshot value, classifying it as a 'clip' resolution instead of a conflict.

Added test cases to verify the behavior when the main value is initially null. The test covers scenarios where a record's field has a null value in the main data source, but is updated with non-null values in the data clip. The test verifies that the resolutions are correctly identified as 'clip' or 'conflict' based on the updated logic.

For developers using this package, the changes enhance the handling of null values in the main data source when generating resolutions for data clips. If a field has a null value in the main data and a non-null value in the data clip, it will be appropriately classified as a 'clip' resolution instead of a conflict, allowing for better management of data clip changes.

Code example:

```typescript
if (record.values.firstName.value === 'mary') {
  expect(record.values.phone.clipValue).toBe('1111111111')
  expect(record.values.phone.snapshotValue).toBeNull()
  expect(record.values.phone.value).toBeNull()
  expect(record.resolves).toContainEqual({
    type: 'resolve',
    field: 'phone',
    resolveTo: 'clip',
  })
}
```
