The order of imports from the `@flatfile/api` module has been updated. The `RecordUpdates` and `Success` types are now imported in a different order.

The implementation of the `clearColumn` method has been refactored. Instead of using the `map` and `filter` array methods, it now uses the `reduce` method to generate the `recordsUpdates` array. The new implementation checks if the field value exists and if the field is not read-only before clearing it. This change likely improves performance and readability.

The wording of the `info` and `outcome.message` properties in the `transitionJob` call has been updated from "Column was removed" to "Column was cleared". This change provides more accurate messaging about the action performed.

Additionally, the code now handles read-only fields correctly. If a field is marked as read-only in the `RecordConfig`, its value will not be cleared.

These changes improve the functionality, performance, and messaging of the `clearColumn` logic without introducing any breaking changes to the external interface.
