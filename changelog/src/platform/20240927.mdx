`@flatfile/api@1.9.17`

Secrets have been updated to introduce new optional fields for filtering.

A new optional `actorId` field of type `ActorId` has been added to the `ListSecrets` request type and `WriteSecret` type for secrets. 
This allows filtering secrets by the associated actor (user, guest, agent, or api key).
