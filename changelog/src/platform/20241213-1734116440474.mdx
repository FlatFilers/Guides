The release notes include the following changes:

The AddRecords class has been updated to sanitize the source (src) object of a changeset before storing it in the database. The cleanSrc method has been added to replace any special characters (specifically the null character '\u0000') in string values of the src object with an empty string. This ensures that the JSON representation of the src object does not contain any characters that are not allowed in PostgreSQL JSONB columns. The JSON stringification of the sanitized src object is now performed after the sanitization step.
