The updates include changes to how the Flatfile platform handles app autobuilds and blueprint generation.

The AppAutobuildDeployLogic no longer writes a blueprint.ts file during the deployment process. The logic for removing AI sample data actions from the blueprint has been removed.

The AppsService now updates the associated space to be a template when an app with an autobuild is activated. This involves updating the space's name and setting the isAppTemplate property to true.

The AppsRepository has been updated to return the app and autobuild separately when fetching an app with its autobuild. The getAppByIdWithAutoBuilds method has been renamed to getAppByIdWithAutoBuild.

The SpacesEvents class now includes a handleUpdateSpaceEvent method to handle updating a space's configuration, which is used when updating the space to be a template during app activation.

The basic-listener template has been updated to use the new @flatfile/plugin-space-configure-from-template plugin instead of custom logic for configuring the space. The plugin handles creating or updating workbooks based on a template blueprint.

The basic-listener-node-modules.tar file in the templates directory has been updated, likely with new or updated plugin dependencies.

Example usage:

```typescript
import { configureSpaceFromTemplate } from '@flatfile/plugin-space-configure-from-template'

listener.namespace(namespace, (namespacedEvents) => {
  namespacedEvents.use(configureSpaceFromTemplate())
})
```
