New Field Types for Complex Data Structures

Three new field types have been added to enhance Flatfile's data modeling capabilities:

1. `embedded-record`
   - Allows storing nested records within a single field
   - Supports complex data structures with their own schema
   - Useful for storing structured data like addresses or contact details

2. `embedded-record-list`
   - Enables storing arrays of nested records
   - Each record in the list follows a defined schema
   - Perfect for managing lists of related data (e.g., multiple contacts or addresses)

3. `reference-query`
   - Extends the reference field type with filtering capabilities
   - Allows querying referenced data based on specific field values
   - Includes configuration for reference key and filter value

These new field types provide more flexibility in handling complex data structures and relationships within Flatfile workbooks.
