## AI-Powered Recommendations

The Flatfile assistant now provides intelligent, contextual recommendations to help users accomplish common tasks more efficiently. When opening the assistant in an empty space, users will immediately see suggested actions based on their current context.

### Key Features

- **Contextual Suggestions**: The assistant analyzes the current workspace and provides relevant recommendations for next steps
- **One-Click Actions**: Users can select any recommendation to immediately execute that action or start a guided workflow
- **Confidence-Based Ranking**: Recommendations are prioritized based on relevance to the current task
- **Detailed Explanations**: Each recommendation includes a description of what it does and why it might be helpful

This enhancement makes Flatfile more intuitive for new users and more efficient for experienced users by reducing the need to manually search for or remember common operations.
