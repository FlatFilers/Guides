# New row insertion feature in Flatfile's data tables

- Users can now add new rows by hovering over row dividers in the index column
- An "Insert row" button appears when hovering between rows
- Clicking the button adds a new row at the selected position
- The feature provides a more intuitive way to add data at specific positions in a table

This enhancement improves the user experience by making row insertion more discoverable and allowing precise control over where new rows are added in the dataset.
