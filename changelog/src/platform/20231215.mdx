    "type": "string"
  },
]
```

**Default Value Added to `inputForm` fields**

We've enhanced the `inputForm` feature in Actions by supporting `defaultValue` settings for enums, strings, and textarea field types.

**Usage**

```jsx
"inputForm": {
  "type": 'simple',
  "fields": [
    {
      "key": 'planName',
      "label": 'Plan Name',
      "type": 'string',
      "description": 'The name of the plan',
      "defaultValue": 'Default plan'
    },
  ]
}
```

This update allows for more intuitive and efficient data entry, as default values can be pre-filled in these fields, streamlining the user experience.
