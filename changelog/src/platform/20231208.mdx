**Enhanced Theming options for Badges+**

![image](../changelog/images/theming_badges.png)

We're excited to announce new additions to our theming capabilities, allowing for even more customization and a refined user experience.

**Usage**

```jsx
"theme": {
  "root": {
    "pillBorderRadius": "0px",
    "badgeBorderRadius":"10em"
  },
  "table": {
    "buttons": {
      "pill": {
        "color": "white",
        "backgroundColor": "magenta"
      },
      "iconColor": "magenta"
    }
  }
}
```

**What's New:**

1. Pill and Badge Border Radius Customization: You can now tailor the border radius of pills and badges within space theming. This update enables you to define and apply a consistent look across all pills and badges in the space according to your design preferences.

2. Toolbar Button Color Theming: We've also introduced the option to customize the color of toolbar buttons, giving you more control over the visual style of your toolbar.

3. Inherited and Customizable Toolbar Filters: Toolbar filters will automatically inherit the pill border radius settings for a unified appearance. However, this can be overridden to suit specific design needs, offering both convenience and flexibility.

These enhancements are part of our ongoing commitment to providing a versatile and user-friendly platform that caters to your unique theming requirements.
