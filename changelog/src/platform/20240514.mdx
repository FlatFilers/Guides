**New Environment Lifecycle Events**

We've added new domain `Environment` events expanding the scope of domains our system recognizes. To leverage these events, you can listen on to the following topics:
The corresponding event topics are `environment:created`, `environment:updated`, and `environment:deleted`.

**Enhanced Job Configuration Descriptions**

We have added descriptions for the DeleteRecordsJobConfig properties to provide better clarity:
An optional `filter` param allows allows you to provide options to filter records, with the default set to none while the `filterField` param enables narrowing the valid/error filter results to a specific field, but it requires the filter to be set.

We corrected a typo in the `JobOutcomeNextFiles` type by renaming the file property to files to accurately represent an array of file objects.
