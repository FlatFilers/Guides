The FileUploadButton component has been updated to remove the unnecessary div element that previously wrapped the Button component. This change simplifies the component's structure by directly rendering the Button component without an additional wrapping div. The AMP_TOOLTIP_ID prop, previously passed to the div, has also been removed as it is no longer needed.
