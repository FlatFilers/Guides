The updates in this diff include the following:

A new feature has been added to generate tool suggestions for data transformation tasks. This feature includes:

1. A new endpoint `/internal/sheets/:sheetId/generate-tool-suggestions` that accepts column keys to analyze and returns a ranked list of suggested transformation tools based on the data structure and patterns.

2. Two analysis strategies for generating tool suggestions:
   - Pattern-based analysis: Fast execution (around 0.11ms on average) with 62.5% accuracy in testing. This strategy uses structural pattern matching and is good for simple transformations.
   - LLM (Large Language Model) analysis: Higher accuracy (93.8% in testing) but slower execution (around 494ms on average). This strategy uses context-aware suggestions from the Claude 3 Haiku model and is better suited for complex scenarios.

3. Comprehensive testing framework with 16 test cases covering various data scenarios, including nested data structures, mixed data types, null handling, and complex formatting requirements.

4. New dependencies: `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock` and `ai` libraries for LLM analysis.

5. Example usage:

```typescript
POST /internal/sheets/:sheetId/generate-tool-suggestions
{
    "columnKeys": ["first_name", "last_name"]
}
// Response
{
  "data": ["combine", "split", "firstAvailable"]
}
```

This feature allows developers to get intelligent suggestions for the most appropriate transformation tools based on their data structure and patterns, improving the efficiency and accuracy of data transformation tasks.
