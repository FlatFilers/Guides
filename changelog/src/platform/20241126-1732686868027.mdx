The release notes include the following updates:

The naming convention for constraints and indexes in snapshots has been modified. Instead of appending a random suffix to the name, the sheet ID is replaced with the snapshot ID in the name. This change ensures consistent naming across different snapshot operations.

For constraints, the constraint name is replaced with the new name following the updated naming convention, and the constraint definition is updated accordingly. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE snapshot_table_name ADD CONSTRAINT new_constraint_name constraint_definition
```

For indexes, the index name is replaced with the new name following the updated naming convention. The index type (UNIQUE or non-unique) and the columns remain the same. For example:

```sql
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX new_index_name ON snapshot_table_name (column1, column2, ...)
```

These changes ensure consistent and predictable naming for constraints and indexes across different snapshot operations, making it easier to manage and maintain snapshots.
