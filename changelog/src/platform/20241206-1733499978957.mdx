In this release:

The SheetTabs component now uses the mockUseBuildModeContext helper from the test utils.

The SheetView component now uses the useTableScroller hook from @flatfile/turntable to enable scrolling to a specific column index when editing fields in the build mode sidebar. It implements scroll handling on window resize and cleanup when unmounting. The scroll logic is extracted into a new utility function getScrollLeftForIndex.

The TransformPreview's useScrollTo hook now uses the new getScrollLeftForIndex utility function.

A new scrollUtils file is added containing the getScrollLeftForIndex utility function to calculate the scroll position to center a column in the viewport.

In the BlueprintSidebar, when selecting a field to edit, it now scrolls the sheet table to center the selected column. It uses the new setScrollToColumnIndex function from the BuildModeContext.

The EditFieldForm component's Content is now set to not be scrollable to prevent nested scrollbars.

The BuildModeSidebar container is now styled with a stable scrollbar gutter and increased width.

The Content component in the sidebar styles now accepts a scrollable prop to control whether it should have overflow scrolling or not.

The SpacePageLayout component now uses the mockUseBuildModeContext helper from the test utils.

The BuildModeContext now exposes scrollToColumnIndex and setScrollToColumnIndex state to control scrolling to a specific column index in the sheet table.

The useSheetAccess hook is updated to use the mockUseBuildModeContext helper from the test utils in its tests.

Overall, these changes add the ability to scroll the sheet table to a specific column when editing fields in the build mode sidebar, and make some style adjustments to the sidebar.
