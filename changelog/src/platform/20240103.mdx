        **Enhanced Visibility with Status Updates During File Extraction**
        
        ![image](../changelog/images/extract-status.gif)

        A Toast now displays intermediate states to keep you informed every step of the way during file extraction.

        When uploading a file directly to the table, you’ll see statuses like “Waiting for Extraction”, “Extracting”, and “Unsupported File”, along with detailed information about the outcome of extraction jobs.

        When uploading on the Files page, the error message is toned down to an info message, as uploading files without an extractor is a legitimate scenario.

        These updates are aimed at enhancing transparency and efficiency, ensuring you’re well-informed throughout the file extraction process.

        **Improved Search Functionality for Null Values in GET Records Endpoint**

        We've refined the search mechanism for empty cells in the GET records endpoint. In the past, users would specify `null` in the `searchValue` parameter to locate empty cells. However, this method posed ambiguity as it didn't clearly distinguish between an exact search for null values and a partial search for the string "null".

        Now, to accurately search for cells with null values, you should use empty double quotes `""` in the `searchValue` parameter.

        [See the endpoint](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/records/get-records)
