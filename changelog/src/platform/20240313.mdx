**Intuitive Column Management in Real-Time**

We've refined our column management experience to align with your expectations for immediate, responsive interactions. Key updates include:

Instant Feedback: Adjustments made within the column management panel now reflect instantly on the table. This immediate update ensures you can dynamically manage your view without waiting for panel closure.

Enhanced User Experience: This change addresses feedback regarding the previous UX, where updates only occurred post-panel closure, leading to confusion. Now, you can see the impact of your selections or deselections in real-time, making for a more intuitive and satisfying user experience.

These improvements are designed to make your data management processes more efficient and user-friendly, allowing for seamless adjustments to your viewing preferences on the fly.
