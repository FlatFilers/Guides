        - The version number in package.json has been updated from 1.9.5 to 1.9.6.
        - In AgentConfig type, a new optional property `sourceMap` of type string has been added. This allows including a source map for the agent code.

        No other significant changes to external interfaces or functionality were detected. The release mainly involves an internal version bump and the addition of an optional sourceMap field to the AgentConfig type, which developers can use to provide source maps for their agent code.
