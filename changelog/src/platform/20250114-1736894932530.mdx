The release includes the following updates:

The z-index value of the overlay element in the SheetViewEmptyStates component has been updated from 200 to 30. This change may affect the stacking order of elements in the application.

In the DevBanner component, the BannerTab element now has the white-space: nowrap CSS property applied, which prevents text from wrapping to the next line.

The tailwind.config.ts file has been updated to include additional z-index values ranging from 10 to 90. This change provides more granular control over the stacking order of elements in the application.
