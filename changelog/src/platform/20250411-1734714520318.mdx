**Updated Default Data Retention Period**

The default data retention period has been updated from 10 days to 365 days, providing users with a longer default timeframe for data storage. Additionally, the description text has been simplified to "Keeps data for a set duration from its collection" without referencing a specific policy timeframe.

This change gives users more time to work with their data before it expires, while maintaining the flexibility to configure custom retention periods as needed.
