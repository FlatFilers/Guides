#### Saving and Sharing Custom Views

Users can now apply filters, sorting, and search queries to the Sheet data and
save those settings as a reusable view. Key changes include:

- Added a "Views" dropdown in the Sheet toolbar to manage and apply saved views.
- Added a "Save View" modal that allows users to name and save the current Sheet
  filters/sorting as a view.
- Users can copy a sharable link with the view settings applied.
- Saved views are grouped into "My Views" and "All Views" sections.
- Added backend APIs to create, update, and delete saved views.
- Added new React hooks and components to support the saved views functionality.
- Updated translations for the new UI elements related to saved views.
