- Users can copy a sharable link with the view settings applied.
- Saved views are grouped into "My Views" and "All Views" sections.
- Added backend APIs to create, update, and delete saved views.
- Added new React hooks and components to support the saved views functionality.
- Updated translations for the new UI elements related to saved views.
