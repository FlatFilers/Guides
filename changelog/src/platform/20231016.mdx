In the past, when your Space took more than 10 seconds to build, an "empty space
created" message would appear. With our latest update, as long as you
acknowledge the space:configure job, you can rest assured this dialog will no

**New: Embed Sheets inside Documents**

Now, by simply incorporating the `embed` HTML entity into your markdown body and
providing the sheet ID, workbook ID, and name, you can effortlessly embed Sheets
into Documents. Additionally, you have the flexibility to choose whether the
embedded Sheet starts in an expanded or collapsed state when the document is
loaded.

```html
<embed
  type="embedded-sheet"
  name="Contacts"
  defaultExpanded="true"
  sheetId="your_sheet_id"
  workbookId="your_workbook_id"
/>
```

This enhancement provides further freedom to tailor document-driven interactions
precisely to your needs.
