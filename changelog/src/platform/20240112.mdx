**Toolbar blocking jobs Extended to Workbook-Mounted Actions**

We've extended the functionality of the `toolbarBlocking` job mode beyond
individual Sheets. Now, when it's applied to Workbook-mounted actions, this mode
also disables workbook actions (including all of the Sheets actions/toolbars)
during a job's progress. By its nature, it also still allows interaction with
the actual data tables.

This enhancement provides more consistent control throughout your entire
Workbook, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and without accidental
interference or unintended navigation.

**State-Based Messaging on Actions via Tooltips**

We've introduced an exciting new capability to enhance user interaction and
feedback in our application. You can now add custom messages to actions,
tailored according to their state:

- Error
- Info

These messages will be displayed as tooltips when users hover over an action,
providing context-specific text that corresponds to the action's current state.

[Follow the guide](../guides/actions#usage-7)

**Decoupling Actions Updates from the Workbook's Schema**

Previously, using workbook update endpoint necessitated submitting all the
fields, even for minor adjustments to an action. Now, with our improved `PATCH`
endpoint, you can update actions without needing to include the `fields`
property in your payload.

This refinement simplifies the update process, focusing solely on the changes
you intend to make.

Previously, users experienced difficulties in adjusting column sizes correctly
when other columns were either hidden or pinned. This fix ensures seamless and
accurate resizing of columns, regardless of the visibility or status of adjacent
columns, enhancing the overall usability and functionality of the data table.
