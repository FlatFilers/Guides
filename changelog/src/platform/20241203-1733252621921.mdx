The release includes the following changes:

A new column `parent_sheet_id` of type `VARCHAR(32)` has been added to the `sheets` table. This column will hold the ID of the parent sheet if the current sheet is a data clip created from another sheet.

The `getSheets` method in the `WorkbookRepository` has been updated to exclude child sheets (data clips) by default when fetching sheets from a workbook. This ensures that only the main/source sheets are shown in the left sheet section and tab section. A new optional parameter `includeChildren` has been introduced to include child sheets if set to `true`.

A new method `getDataClippedSheets` has been added to the `WorkbooksService` to fetch all sheets, including data clips (child sheets), from a workbook.

The `getSheetBySlug` method in the `WorkbookRepository` has been updated to exclude child sheets when fetching a sheet by its slug. This is because data clips and the source sheet share the same slug.

A new method `getSheetsBySlug` has been added to the `WorkbooksService` to fetch a sheet by its slug, including any data clips (child sheets) associated with it.

The `createSheet` method in the `WorkbookRepository` and `WorkbooksService` now accepts an optional `parentSheetId` parameter. This parameter is used when creating a new sheet as a data clip of an existing sheet, allowing the new sheet to be linked to its parent sheet.

Various test cases and mock data have been updated to account for the new data clip functionality and the `parent_sheet_id` column.
