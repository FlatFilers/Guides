External links in Documents (both Markdown and HTML) now automatically open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`). This improvement ensures that users don't navigate away from the Flatfile interface when clicking on links within documents, maintaining their current context and workflow.

This change applies to all links in documents, whether they're created using Markdown syntax or HTML anchor tags.
