The release notes provide the following updates:

Implemented the ability to fetch distinct values for a specific field with error and valid counts by passing `distinct=true&fieldKey=<field_key>&includeCounts=true`. This returns all the distinct values for the given field along with their total count, valid count, and error count.

Added support for sorting the distinct values when fetching with counts by using the `sortField` and `sortDirection` parameters.

Implemented fetching distinct values for all fields in a sheet with counts by passing `distinct=true&includeCounts=true`. This returns an object with all fields as keys and their distinct values with counts as the values.

Fixed an issue where fetching distinct values for a specific field without counts (`distinct=true&fieldKey=<field_key>`) was not correctly applying filters.

Added a new test case to verify that the error counts are calculated correctly when fetching distinct values with counts for a field with a unique constraint.

For example, to get distinct values for the "name" field with counts and sorted by name in ascending order:

```
/sheets/:sheetId/cells?distinct=true&fieldKey=name&includeCounts=true&sortField=name&sortDirection=asc
```
