**Removed Character Limit on Mappings, Jobs, and Enum Mappings**

We have lifted the previous 255-character limit for mappings, jobs, and enum mappings. This update allows for greater flexibility and more detailed entries in these areas.

**New API Feature to Restore Archived Spaces**

API users now have the capability to restore an archived space. This can be done by setting the `archivedAt` property of the space to null via the `PATCH /spaces/:spaceId` endpoint.

**Improved Cascade Deletion for Spaces, Workbooks, and Sheets**

We've enhanced the deletion process for Spaces. In the past, deleting a Space did not automatically cascade to its Workbooks and Sheets. Now, with the latest update, soft deleting a Space will also soft delete its associated Workbooks and Sheets.

Furthermore, we've refined the `GET /workbooks` query. It now filters out workbooks linked to previously deleted Spaces, ensuring that only relevant and active workbooks are displayed. This update is helpful for Spaces deleted before this improvement was implemented.

**Enhanced Display of Enum Options in Turntable**

We've addressed an issue in the table where enum options without a label were incorrectly displaying as 'undefined'. With the latest update, in cases where an enum option lacks a label, the table will now default to showing the option's value instead.

This ensures a more accurate and user-friendly display of data.
