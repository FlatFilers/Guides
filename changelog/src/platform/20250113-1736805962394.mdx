The TabStrip component's styling has been updated. The CSS class 'h-8' has been removed from the div containing the tabs, allowing the height to be determined dynamically based on the content. This change provides more flexibility in the layout and styling of the tab strip, potentially improving the user experience by preventing unnecessary clipping or spacing issues caused by a fixed height.
