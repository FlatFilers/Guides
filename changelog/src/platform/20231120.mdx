**You can now disable Actions when there are invalid records**

![image](../changelog/images/hasAllValid.gif)

Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all rows were valid,
essential for preventing unintended data egress.

Now, developers can now add an optional flag to Actions, preventing users from
initiating Actions when Sheets or Workbooks contain invalid records.

```jsx
actions: [{
  ...
  constraints: [{ type: 'hasAllValid' }]
  ...
}]
```

Add a `constraints` parameter in your Action that includes `type: hasAllValid,`
to disable actions when there are invalid records.

## spaces

We made an enhancement to bulk cell pasting. Previously, locking the cell
occurred prematurely, causing values to flash after pasting. Now, locking is
effectively executed later, resulting in a smoother and more stable pasting
experience.

## spaces

**Space ID Search is now available in the Spaces Table**

We've added a new feature that allows you to search for spaces using their Space
ID in the Spaces table. This enhancement simplifies the process of locating
specific spaces quickly and efficiently.
