      **Resolved Document Auto-Update Issue**

       We fixed an issue where Documents weren't automatically updating in response to event stream activities (such as document creation, updates, or deletions). This fix ensures that document changes are now promptly reflected in the UI, keeping your Space synchronized with all recent activities.
