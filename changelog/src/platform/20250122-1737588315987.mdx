The release introduces the ability to filter spaces by the associated app ID
when retrieving a list of spaces. A new query parameter `appId` has been added
to the `/v1/spaces` endpoint. Developers can now pass the `appId` query
parameter to retrieve only the spaces associated with the specified app. For
example, `?appId=us_app_123` will return only spaces linked to the app with ID
`us_app_123`. If an invalid or non-existent app ID is provided, an empty list
will be returned.
