The release introduces the ability to filter spaces by the associated app ID when retrieving a list of spaces. A new query parameter `appId` has been added to the `/v1/spaces` endpoint. Developers can now pass the `appId` query parameter to retrieve only the spaces associated with the specified app. The release also includes tests to verify the new filtering functionality. For example, `?appId=us_app_123` will return only spaces linked to the app with ID `us_app_123`. If an invalid or non-existent app ID is provided, an empty list will be returned.
