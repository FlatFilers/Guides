The release notes summarize the following changes:

Added support for ordering sheets in a workbook based on their position. Sheets will now be displayed in the configured order across different components such as SheetTabs, SummaryView, and SidebarWorkbook.

Improved the CodeView component by adding scrolling to the top of the editor when the sheet data changes, better error handling, and displaying error annotations with line and column numbers.

Removed the "Data Checklist" option from the Sidebar Config, as it is no longer needed.

Enhanced the Theme Sidebar by using a storage key specific to the space ID for storing the company URL, improving performance and avoiding conflicts between spaces.

Added a background color to the custom input field in the Sidebar for better visibility.

Improved error handling and query invalidation logic in various mutations and operations related to workbooks and sheets.

Optimized rendering performance by using the useMemo hook to memoize the ordered sheets calculation across different components.
