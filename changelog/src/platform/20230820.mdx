**🚀 Introducing Command+k Triggered Search and Transformation (Early Access)**

![image](../changelog/images/AI-assist.png)

This update enhances your workflow by centralizing experiences under the Command+k shortcut.

A straightforward forward slash, followed by these options, grants access to our data transformation and query tools:

- `/transform` (AI-powered)
- `/query` (AI-powered)
- `/search` (global search)
- `/filter` (Flatfile Query Language, ffql)
- `/in` (field-specific search)

## dataxp

There is now a count at the top of the files list that shows the total
number of files.

## spaces

The Sidebar now has three different states:

- Collapsed state
- Open state
- Totally hidden state

Additionally, the Sidebar will now automatically collapse itself on smaller screens.

## spaces

We now handle overflowing space name(s) by:

- Breaking the word
- Limiting the name to two lines and giving it an ellipsis if it overflows
- Adding a tooltip with the space name to truncated names
- Previously, badge names in the data checklist could break to two lines making them hard to read. This is also fixed.

## theming

When determining the lighter shades of each main theme colors, i.e. primary,
danger, warning and success, there are now checks to ensure no colors end up
as white.

## files

The filename was added to the mapping scene so users can now see which file
they are currently mapping.

## files

Cells with no data can now be unmapped using “Do not import”, if previously
mapped to a value.

## dataxp

Filter: "Last Name" like A% will now retrieve all records where Last Name
starts with “A”. Previously, it was retrieving records that contained “A”.

## dataxp

The continue button is now disabled on mapping scene while mappings are
loading. This ensures user can only advance to review scene after mappings
are saved.
