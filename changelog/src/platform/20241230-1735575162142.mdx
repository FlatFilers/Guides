This release includes the following updates:

The application now automatically extracts CSV files into DuckDB as the default storage strategy. If the SourceEditor entitlement is enabled, CSV files are automatically extracted into Quickstore instead. 

New utility functions have been added to handle trailing empty rows in CSV files during extraction. The `copyFileWithoutTrailingEmptyRows` function creates a temporary copy of the CSV file without any trailing empty rows. The `fileEndsWithEmptyCsvRecords` function checks if a CSV file ends with empty records.

During the DuckDB extraction process, if the input CSV file ends with empty records, a temporary copy of the file without trailing empty rows is created and used for extraction. The temporary file is cleaned up after the extraction.

The extraction logic has been updated to handle encoding conversions and file copying differently for DuckDB and Quickstore extractions.

Example usage for the developer:

```typescript
// Check if a CSV file ends with empty records
const fileEndsWithEmptyRecords = await fileEndsWithEmptyCsvRecords('/path/to/file.csv', ',')

// Create a temporary copy of a CSV file without trailing empty rows
await copyFileWithoutTrailingEmptyRows({
  source: { path: '/path/to/source.csv', encoding: 'utf8' },
  destination: { path: '/path/to/destination.csv', encoding: 'utf8' },
  delimiter: ','
})
```
