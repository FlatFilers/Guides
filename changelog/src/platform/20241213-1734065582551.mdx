Added two new event topics related to data clip resolutions: 'data-clip:resolutions-created' and 'data-clip:resolutions-updated'. These events will be emitted when data clip resolutions are created or updated, respectively.

Updated the getResolutions method to emit the 'data-clip:resolutions-created' event after fetching the resolutions. Similarly, the updateResolutions method now emits the 'data-clip:resolutions-updated' event after updating the resolutions.

Modified the UpdateResolutionsLogic to pass the grant object when calling the dataClipsService.updateResolutions method. The grant is now also required when calling dataClipsService.getResolutions.

In the DataClipsController, added the @GrantParam() decorator to pass the grant object to the getResolutions and updateResolutions methods.

Enhanced the dataClips.e2e-spec.ts file to verify the emission of the new 'data-clip:resolutions-created' and 'data-clip:resolutions-updated' events during testing.
