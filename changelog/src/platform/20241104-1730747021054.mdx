The release notes summarizing the changes from the provided diff are:

Added a new table `constraint_version` to store versions of constraints. When a constraint is created, updated, or deleted, a new version of the constraint will be created in the `constraint_version` table. The `Constraint` model now has a `versions` field linking it to the `ConstraintVersion` model. The `Prompt` model also has a new `constraintVersion` field linking it to the `ConstraintVersion` model.

Added new methods to the `ConstraintsRepository` to handle creating, retrieving, and deleting constraint versions. These include `getConstraintVersions`, `getConstraintVersion`, `createConstraintVersion`, and `getMaxConstraintVersion`.

Added new methods to the `ConstraintsController` to allow retrieving constraint versions: `getConstraintVersions` and `getConstraintVersion`.

Modified the `ConstraintsRepository.createConstraint` and `ConstraintsRepository.updateConstraint` methods to create a new constraint version when creating or updating a constraint. The `updateConstraint` method now accepts an optional `promptId` parameter to associate a prompt with the new constraint version.

Modified the `ConstraintsService.updateConstraint` method to accept an optional `promptId` parameter and pass it to the repository.

Added a new `ConstraintVersionModel` to handle constraint version data.

Added a new migration file `20241009130436_add_constraint_versions_table` to create the `constraint_version` table and set up foreign key relationships.
