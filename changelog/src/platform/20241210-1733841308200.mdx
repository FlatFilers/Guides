The release includes the following updates:

A new SpacesService dependency has been added to the JobsResource, JobsService, and JobsWorker classes to interact with the Space metadata. The AppAutobuildDeployLogic now retrieves the space metadata, including theme and sidebarConfig, and injects this metadata into the generated listener code as new constants.

The blueprint passed to the listener code now excludes any "ai-generate-sample-data" actions from the sheet fields. This is done by introducing a new removeAiSampleDataActions helper function.

The basic-listener template code has been updated to include placeholders for the new space metadata constants, and conditionally update the space metadata if the constants are present.

For developers using this package, the main change is the ability to configure the space theme and sidebar settings through the listener code generated by the AppAutobuildDeployLogic. The listener will now update the space metadata with the provided theme and sidebarConfig objects. Additionally, the blueprint passed to the listener will no longer include any "ai-generate-sample-data" actions.

Example usage:

```typescript
const theme = { primaryColor: '#ff0000' }
const sidebarConfig = { defaultOpen: true }
```
