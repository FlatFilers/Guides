An error is now thrown if attempting to clear a readonly column in a sheet. This
prevents modifying data in readonly columns.

Example:

```
const field = {
  key: 'ReadonlyColumn',
  label: 'Readonly Column',
  type: 'string',
  readonly: true
}
```

Attempting to clear this column will throw an error: 'Column is readonly and
cannot be cleared'.

An error is also thrown if attempting to clear any column in a readonly sheet.
This prevents modifying data in readonly sheets.

Example:

```
const sheet = {
  config: {
    readonly: true,
    fields: [...]
  }
}
```

Attempting to clear a column in this sheet will throw an error: 'Sheet is
readonly. Column cannot be cleared'.

These changes ensure data integrity by preventing unintended modification of
readonly data.
