The SidebarLogo component has been updated to conditionally render the logo based on the user's entitlements and the availability of a custom logo. The changes include importing the useEntitlements hook and checking if the user has the 'whitelabeling' entitlement. If whitelabeling is enabled and no custom logo is provided, the component will not render any logo. This allows for better control over branding and ensures that the default Flatfile logo is not displayed when whitelabeling is enabled but no custom logo is provided.
