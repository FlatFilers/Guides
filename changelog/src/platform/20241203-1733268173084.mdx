The release notes for these changes are:

This release includes improvements to the email notifications system for DataClips. When a new DataClip is created, invitation emails will be sent to all collaborators, including both registered users and guests. The emails will contain a direct link to the DataClip, making it easier for collaborators to access the shared content. The invitation message will also include the name and description of the DataClip, as well as the name of the user who invited them.

For guests, the invitation link will include the guest's email address as a query parameter to facilitate authentication. For registered users, the link will be a direct URL to the DataClip.

The email template for these invitations can now be customized using the new `sendUserInvitationEmail` method in the AuthService. This method accepts a `template` parameter to specify a custom Handlebars template file.

Improvements have also been made to handle email validation and prevent sending emails to invalid addresses. The new `sendUserEmail` method in the MailerService performs address validation before sending the email. If the address is invalid, the email will not be sent.

Overall, these changes enhance the collaboration experience for DataClips by providing a more streamlined invitation process and better handling of email notifications.
