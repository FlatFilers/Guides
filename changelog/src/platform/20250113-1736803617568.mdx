The release includes the following updates:

The BlurResource component now adds a z-300 class to the DialogContent component displayed when a job is locked, ensuring it appears above other elements.

The background color of the preview area in the MapRouter component has been changed from bg-primary-10 to bg-gray-3, providing a more neutral appearance.

The scrollbar color across the application has been updated to use var(--colors-neutral-gray-alpha-8) for the thumb and var(--colors-base-white) for the track, making it more subtle. Additionally, the scrollbar width has been set to thin.

For elements with the data-testid="sidebar-contents" attribute, the scrollbar color has been customized to use var(--colors-sidebar-focus-background) for the thumb and var(--colors-sidebar-background) for the track, improving the visual integration with the sidebar.
