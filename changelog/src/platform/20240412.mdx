       **Enhanced Cell-Level Control in Records**

       We've introduced a new configuration property that allows users to set individual cells within a record to read-only. This enhancement extends our previous functionality where only entire columns or sheets could be designated as read-only. Now, you can apply more granular control over data manipulation by restricting editing at the cell level, improving data integrity and compliance.

      See the [reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/records/update#request.body.config.readonly).
