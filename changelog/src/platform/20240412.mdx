**Enhanced Cell-Level Control in Records**

We've introduced a new configuration property that allows users to set
individual cells within a record to read-only. This enhancement extends our
previous functionality where only entire columns or sheets could be designated
as read-only. Now, you can apply more granular control over data manipulation by
restricting editing at the cell level, improving data integrity and compliance.

**Fixed Sheet Name Sanitization for Downloads**

We've improved the file download process by sanitizing sheet names that contain forward slashes. Previously, when a sheet had a name with forward slashes (e.g., "people/Contacts"), downloading the sheet could cause issues with file paths. Now, forward slashes in sheet names are automatically replaced with underscores when generating download filenames, ensuring a smooth download experience regardless of the sheet naming convention used.
