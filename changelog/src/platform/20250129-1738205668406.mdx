Added the ability to remove atoms for multiple fields when updating a sheet's fields. Now when fields are removed from a sheet's configuration, the corresponding atoms (src, artifacts, shadow, and messages) are cleaned up for those field keys. Removed a separate method for removing atoms for a single field, now using the new removeAtoms method that takes an array of fieldKeys.

To remove atoms for a single field, use:

```typescript
await this.ephemeral.forWorkbook(workbook).utils.removeAtom({
  sheet, 
  fieldKey
})
```

To remove atoms for multiple fields, use:

```typescript 
await this.ephemeral.forWorkbook(workbook).utils.removeAtoms({
  sheet,
  fieldKeys: ['field1', 'field2', ...]
})
```

This ensures that when fields are removed from a sheet configuration, any associated atoms are properly cleaned up from the database, preventing stale data buildup.
