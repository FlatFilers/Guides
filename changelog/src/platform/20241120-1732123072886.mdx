Added a new test file for the DataClipsRepository class. The file contains a placeholder test case that simply asserts true to be true. The file includes a comment explaining that the generated tests were omitted due to an issue, but the repository code is covered by end-to-end tests. While no functional tests were added, this change allows for future tests to be added as needed.
