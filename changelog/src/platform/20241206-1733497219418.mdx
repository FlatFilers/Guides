The release notes include the following updates:

Added null and undefined checks for EnumProperty config options to prevent potential errors when options are missing or undefined. This ensures the code handles missing or undefined enum options gracefully.

Updated the AI Generate Sample Data job logic to process each sheet in a workbook concurrently using Promise.all instead of sequentially. This should improve performance when generating sample data for multiple sheets.

Introduced a new ensureValidJson utility function in the AI Faker driver. This function is used to clean and sanitize generated JSON data, ensuring it is valid JSON by escaping quotes and removing invalid backslash sequences. This is a hack specifically for handling data generated by the Faker library.

In the AI Faker driver, added an additional check to ensure the enum field config options exist before attempting to generate enum values. This adds extra robustness for handling missing or undefined enum options.

No external interface changes were introduced. These updates are internal improvements for handling edge cases, improving performance, and ensuring data integrity when generating sample data.
