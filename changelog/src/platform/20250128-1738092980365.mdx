The release notes include updates to the user interface for extracting data from files. A new "extraction" section has been added with messages related to the file extraction process, such as "Retrieving file", "Parsing sheets", "Creating workbook", and various error messages like "Failed to create workbook. See Event Logs.", "No sheets found", "File is too large to parse. Try converting this file to CSV.", "Failed to parse workbook.", and "Extraction failed. Try again or reach out to Support." These messages provide feedback to the user during the file extraction process, including updates on the progress and any errors that may occur. Additionally, there is a message indicating when records are being added to the extracted sheets: "Adding records to Sheets". These updates enhance the user experience by providing clear communication during the file extraction process.
