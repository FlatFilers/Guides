@flatfile/api@1.9.8

A new `reference-list` property type has been added to allow defining an array of values referenced from another sheet. Links will be established automatically by the matching engine or similar upon an evaluation of unique or similar columns between datasets.

The `ReferencePropertyConfig` has been updated to make the `relationship` property optional, allowing it to be omitted.
