`@flatfile/api@1.9.5`

A new property `treatments` of type `Flatfile.WorkbookTreatments[]` has been added to the `Workbook` and `CreateWorkbookConfig` types.
This array allows specifying treatments for a workbook, with the currently available treatment being `ExtractedFromSource`.
This change introduces a new external interface that developers using the package should be aware of when creating or updating workbooks.

Example usage:

```typescript
import { Flatfile } from '@flatfile/api';

const workbookConfig: Flatfile.CreateWorkbookConfig = {
  // ...other properties
  treatments: [Flatfile.WorkbookTreatments.ExtractedFromSource]
};
```
