        **Powered by Flatfile looks a little different now**

        ![image](../changelog/images/powered_by.png)

        Based on user feedback, we've updated the visual design of the "Powered by Flatfile" chip to distinguish it from actionable buttons, enhancing the user interface for clarity.

        <Note>For those interested in a fully branded experience, we offer the option to remove this chip entirely through our [Professional package](https://flatfile.com/pricing/).</Note>

        **Improvements for `trackChanges` functionality**

        For users utilizing the `trackChanges` on their Workbooks (disables your actions until all commits are complete), we’ve addressed a critical workflow concern.

        Changes in a Reference field result in the creation of a new commit event, which was leaving the original commit incomplete. Furthermore, this new commit wasn’t triggering an event emission, leading to a chain of incomplete commits.

        We’ve refined the commit completion process: now, commits will be marked as complete whenever the user explicitly references a commit in an update request.

        This adjustment is handled out of the box with `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook` and ensures a more streamlined and reliable change tracking experience.
