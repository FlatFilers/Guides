      **ðŸš€ Instant Extraction for CSV/TSV/PSV Files**

      With the removal of the extraction step for CSV/TSV/PSV files, the import experience is now more seamless than ever. As soon as the upload is complete, these files are instantly extracted, ensuring an efficient and immediate handling of your data.

      The impact of this change is remarkable. What used to take approximately 3 and a half minutes to extract now concludes in less than 10 seconds.

      In addition, we now natively support TSV and PSV files meaning you don't need to use an extractor plugin to support these file types.

      While speed is the prime advantage, this upgrade doesnâ€™t merely boost performance. It also simplifies and enhances reliability in our system. Previously, concerns about only a fraction of a file being extracted are now history. Furthermore, this approach strategically eases the load on our database, reducing the likelihood of encountering resource limits.

      In essence, itâ€™s a win-win for both efficiency and user experience.
