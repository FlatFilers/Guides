A new font named 'Diatype' has been added with normal and bold weights. The font is being loaded from a WOFF2 file located at '@flatfile/baseline/DiatypeVariable.woff2'. This font has no ligatures and uses the 'swap' font-display strategy for better performance. To use this font, developers can specify 'font-family: "Diatype"' in their CSS styles.
