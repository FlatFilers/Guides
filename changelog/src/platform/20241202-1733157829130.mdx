A bug fix was made to the handling of enum field options when updating a sheet.
Previously, if the `config.options` property was undefined, an error would
occur. Now, if `config.options` is undefined, it defaults to an empty array.
This ensures that the code can safely handle cases where `config.options` is not
present or is undefined. For example, if a developer was updating a sheet with
an enum field that did not previously have any options defined, the update can
now proceed without errors.
