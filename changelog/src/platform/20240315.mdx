**Streamlined User Invitation Process**

We've enhanced our user invitation system for improved clarity and data integrity. Each user can now hold only one active invitation at any given time. Any new invitation issued to a user will automatically replace the previous one. This measure is designed to maintain data accuracy and eliminate user confusion.
