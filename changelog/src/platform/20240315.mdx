**Streamlined User Invitation Process**

We've enhanced our user invitation system for improved clarity and data
integrity. Each user can now hold only one active invitation at any given time.
Any new invitation issued to a user will automatically replace the previous one.
This measure is designed to maintain data accuracy and eliminate user confusion.
