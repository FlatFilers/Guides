The EllipsisTooltip component now accepts a new optional className prop that allows developers to apply custom styles to the component. This can be used to modify the appearance or layout of the EllipsisTooltip.

The SidebarSheet component has been updated with several changes. It now displays an error icon if the sheet contains errors, providing a visual indication to the developer. Additionally, it shows appropriate icons for locked and read-only sheets, along with tooltips explaining their meaning. These changes help developers better understand the state and access level of the sheets they are working with.

The application has also been updated with new translation keys in the 'en/translation.json' file. The 'sidebar.errorIconTooltip' key provides the tooltip text for the error icon, informing developers that the sheet contains errors. The 'sidebar.readOnlyIconTooltip' key has been added, likely for displaying a tooltip for the read-only sheet icon, although it is not used in the provided code.

For example, to display the error icon tooltip, you can add the following markup:

```jsx
<div
  data-tooltip-id={AMP_TOOLTIP_ID}
  data-tooltip-content={t('sidebar.errorIconTooltip')}
>
  <div className="w-[5px] h-[5px] rounded-full bg-destructive-90" />
</div>
```
