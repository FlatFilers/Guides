        **Localization is Now Available**

        ![image](../changelog/images/localization.png)


        We are excited to introduce localization features in Flatfile! Now, your customers will enjoy automatic translations based on their browser locale, including French, German, and Spanish.

        Key Features:

        - Translations are exclusively applied in Spaces (guest areas).
        - Our user-friendly guide will assist you in effortlessly translating and personalizing the content within your space, whether it's custom actions, documents, and more.
        - Require another language? Send us a note, and we'll make it a priority to include it.

        [Follow the guide](../guides/localization) or try the [Localization demo Space](https://platform.flatfile.com/getting-started) to get started.

        **New: Promote Sheet Actions**

        ![image](../changelog/images/primary_actions.png)

       Previously, the `primary:true` concept on Actions didn't affect Sheet actions, leaving them all in the "more actions" drop-down. But now, setting primary to true will showcase these actions right in the Sheet toolbar, as buttons with clear, user-friendly text.

        You can now effortlessly view up to 500k records at once. When you reach the end of the table, a helpful message will appear, reminding you that there's more data waiting. Simply search or filter to reduce the size of your dataset and access it all. This change was added due to browser limitations that restrict maximum height in the DOM.
