The release notes summarize the following changes:

A snapshot of the source sheet is now created before updating a data clip. This snapshot is created using the `workbooksService.createSnapshot` method, providing the sheet ID, a label for the snapshot, and a grant. Relevant details about the snapshot creation, such as the data clip ID, snapshot ID, clip sheet ID, clip sheet name, and creation timestamp, are logged for debugging purposes. This change allows for maintaining a record of the source sheet's state before the data clip update, which can be useful for auditing or reverting changes if needed.

Additionally, when updating a data clip, the code now filters out records that are marked as new rows or removed from the main sheet. This ensures that only existing records are processed during the update operation, preventing potential conflicts or duplication of data.
