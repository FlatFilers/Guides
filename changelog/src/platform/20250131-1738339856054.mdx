Here are the key changes in the code diff:

1. apps/spaces-ui/src/apps/WorkbookApp/TransformPreview/hooks/usePreviewRecords.tsx:
   - Fixed a typo in the error message for the "entilementError" case. It was misspelled as "entilementError" and has been corrected to "entitlementError".

2. apps/spaces-ui/src/i18n.ts:
   - Added import statements for translation JSON files for the following new locales:
     - Spanish (es-419)
     - Malay (ms)
     - Dutch (nl)
     - Polish (pl)
     - Swedish (sv)
     - Thai (th)
     - Chinese Traditional Hong Kong (zh-hant-HK)
   - Added the new locales to the `supportedLanguages` array.
   - Updated the `localTranslations` and `finalTranslations` objects to include the new locales and their respective translation files.

3. apps/spaces-ui/src/locales/en/translation.json:
   - Fixed the typo in the "entilementError" key, renaming it to "entitlementError".

The main change is adding support for seven new locales by importing their translation JSON files and updating the necessary data structures to include them. Additionally, a minor typo correction was made in the English translation file and the corresponding code that references that error message.
