The release adds the ability to mark a space as an app template and filter
spaces based on whether they are app templates or not.

This can be used with the new space-configure-from-template plugin to create new
spaces using an existing space as a template.

When using Autobuild for a new App, the space generated during Autobuild will
automatically be tagged as the template for that App.
