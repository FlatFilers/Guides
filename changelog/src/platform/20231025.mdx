**Disable Actions while Hooks are Running**

![image](../changelog/images/trackChanges.gif)

Previously, developers faced challenges in determining when all hooks had
finished running, essential for ensuring data transformation completion and
preventing unintended data egress. As a workaround, they resorted to creating
placeholder fields that defaulted to invalid states. When a hook completed
processing for a record, it marked the field as valid, allowing submission only
when there were no errors in this field.

Now, we're thrilled to introduce a solution to simplify this process—an all-new
event: `commit:completed`. This event signals the end of all processing tasks.

```jsx
settings: [{ trackChanges: true }];
```

Add a `settings` parameter in your sheet that includes `trackChanges: true,` to
disable actions on both Sheets and Workbooks until any pending commits have been
completed.

**New Job Mode: `toolbar-blocking`**

We're excited to introduce a third job mode called `toolbarBlocking` alongside
the existing `foreground` and `background` modes. With this new mode,
`toolbarBlocking`, you have the flexibility to disable the Sheet Toolbar and
Column Header Menus while still allowing users to enter records manually.
