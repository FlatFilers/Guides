title: "Enhanced Filter Management in Spaces UI"

**Improved Atomic Filter Management**

We've enhanced the filtering experience in the Spaces UI by preventing the creation of multiple "atomic" filters for the same field. Now, when a user attempts to create a filter for a field that already has an existing filter, they will be directed to that existing filter query instead of creating a new one.

This improvement:
- Prevents duplicate filters that could lead to confusion
- Creates a cleaner filtering interface
- Streamlines the filter management experience
- Makes it easier to track and modify existing filters

The change applies specifically to simple field-based filters, ensuring a more intuitive and organized filtering experience.
