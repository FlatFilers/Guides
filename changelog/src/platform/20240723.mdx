@flatfile/api@1.9.7
Here are the release notes for the changes:

The version of the @flatfile/api package has been updated from 1.9.6 to 1.9.7. New options have been added to the ListWorkbooksRequest to allow filtering workbooks by name, namespace, label, and treatment, as well as controlling whether to include sheets. For example, you can now pass a `name` parameter to filter workbooks by name, or a `treatment` parameter to filter by treatment. The `includeSheets` boolean parameter controls whether sheet data is included in the response.
