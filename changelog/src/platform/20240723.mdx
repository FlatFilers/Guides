        `@flatfile/api@1.9.7`

        The release notes indicate the following changes:

The version of the @flatfile/api package has been updated from 1.9.6 to 1.9.7.

For the ListWorkbooks method, several new request parameters have been added:

- name: Filter workbooks by name (prefix with - to negate filter)
- namespace: Filter workbooks by namespace (prefix with - to negate filter)
- label: Filter workbooks by label (prefix with - to negate filter)
- treatment: Filter workbooks by treatment
- includeSheets: Include sheets for each returned workbook (default true)

These new parameters allow developers to filter and customize the list of workbooks returned by the API. For example, they can now filter to only show workbooks with a certain label or namespace.

There were no other user-facing changes mentioned in the diff.
