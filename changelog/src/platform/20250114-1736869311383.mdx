The z-index value for the Overlay component in SheetViewEmptyStates.tsx has been changed from 200 to 30. This change affects the stacking order of the overlay element relative to other elements on the page.

The tailwind.config.ts file has been updated to include new z-index values ranging from 10 to 90. These values can be used to control the stacking order of elements in the application. For example, a developer can now assign a z-index value of 70 to ensure an element is positioned above elements with a lower z-index value.
