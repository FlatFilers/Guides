        **Exciting Update: Additional Fields**

        ![image](../changelog/images/addl_fields.png)

        With additional fields, end users can seamlessly map to fields that don’t exist by simply adding a new property to any of your new or pre-existing Blueprint(s).

        Here’s how it works:
        - When you set allowAdditionalFields to true, your Sheet gains the ability to accept additional fields, extending beyond what’s originally specified in its configuration.
        - These extra fields can be incorporated, either through API integrations or by end users during the file import process.
        - Fields that go beyond the Blueprint’s initial setup are marked with a treatment property set to additional, ensuring complete transparency over what extends the Blueprint.
        - What’s more, adding a custom field is a breeze—its name will be automatically set to match the header name from the file being mapped. This simplifies the process.

        [See the docs](../blueprint/sheet-options).
