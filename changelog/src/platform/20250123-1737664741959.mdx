The package has been updated with the following changes:

The nanoid package has been added as a new dependency. The nanoid library is used to generate unique, alphanumeric, URL-friendly string identifiers.

The SpaceApp component now listens for additional events related to sheet creation, updating, and deletion. This allows the application to react to changes in sheets within the workspace.

The BlueprintSidebar component has been updated to receive the sheetId from the useBuildModeContext hook instead of as a prop. This change improves the component's design and makes it easier to manage state.

The BuildModeSidebar component has been updated with several new features and improvements:

1. A new threadId is generated using nanoid for each session, allowing the chat to maintain context across sessions.
2. A VersionController instance is created to handle version restoration.
3. The useAction hook from the observable API is used to create a restoreVersion action.
4. A new handleRevert function has been added to revert to a specific version snapshot based on the snapshotId.
5. The ChatUI component from the @flatfile/agent-ui package has been integrated, providing a user interface for the chat functionality.
6. Error handling has been improved in the useChat hook, displaying error messages to the user when an error occurs during chat processing.
7. The onRevert prop has been added to the ChatUI component, allowing the user to revert to a previous version snapshot.
8. The usePopover hook from the @flatfile/shared-ui package has been imported and used to display a success message when a rollback is successful.

These changes enhance the application's functionality by adding version control capabilities, improving error handling, and providing a better user experience through the integration of the ChatUI component and popover notifications.
