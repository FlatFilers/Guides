The release notes summarize the following changes:

The `maxLength` and `minLength` props in the `TextArea` styled component have been renamed to `maxHeight` and `minHeight`, respectively. This change impacts developers using the `TextArea` component, as they now need to use the new prop names to set the maximum and minimum height of the textarea. For example:

```jsx
<TextArea
  maxHeight={600}
  minHeight={300}
  // Other props
/>
```

In the `ConstraintFields` component, the `maxLength` and `minLength` props on the textarea element have been updated to use the new `maxHeight` and `minHeight` prop names accordingly.
