Here are the release notes summarizing the changes in the provided diff:

The "data_clips" table has a new column "snapshot_id" of type VARCHAR(32) added to store the snapshot ID associated with each data clip.

The DataClipsController now has new endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data clips. The endpoints are protected by new privileges: "data-clip:create", "data-clip:read", "data-clip:update", and "data-clip:delete".

The DataClipsService has new methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data clips. The createClip method performs various operations like creating a new clipped sheet, creating a snapshot, and persisting the data clip details in the database.

The DataClipsRepository has new methods for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting data clips from the database. It also has a new method getResourceHierarchyOfDataClip to retrieve the account, environment, and space IDs associated with a data clip.

The Entitlements resource now has a new entitlement "DataClipsEnabled" that determines if data clips are enabled. The entitlement influences the privileges "data-clip:create", "data-clip:read", "data-clip:update", and "data-clip:delete".

The WorkbooksService has a new method createSheet that allows creating a new sheet with optional treatments like "CLIPPED_FROM_SHEET".

The WorkbookRepository has updates to the createSheet method to support passing treatments while creating a new sheet.

Overall, these changes introduce the data clips feature, which allows users to create clipped versions of existing sheets along with snapshots, provided they have the necessary entitlement.
