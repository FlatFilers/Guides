`@flatfile/api@1.9.14`

Added a new resource `actions` for managing Flatfile actions. This includes the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete actions. New types related to actions have been added, such as `Action`, `ActionResponse`, `ActionUpdate`, `ActionMount`, and `ApiAction`.

Updated the `agents` resource to include new methods for listing agent versions (`listVersions`), and reverting to a previous agent version (`revert`). New types related to agent versions have been added, such as `AgentVersion`, `AgentVersionResponse`, and `AgentVersionId`.

Added a new method `refreshToken` to the `auth` resource for refreshing access tokens.

Added support for removing fields from sheets via the new `removeField` method in the `sheets` resource. A new request type `CreateFieldRequest` has been introduced, which includes an `insertAtIndex` parameter for specifying the index to insert a new field at.

Added support for array values in cell values (`CellValueUnion` now includes `string[]`).

Added two new job config types: `AppAutobuildDeployJobConfig` and `AiGenerateSampleDataJobConfig`.

Added a new `metadata` field to the `JobConfig` type, allowing additional metadata to be associated with jobs.

Updated the `Event` and `EventTopic` types to include new event types related to actions: `ActionCreated`, `ActionUpdated`, and `ActionDeleted`.

Added a new `actionId` field to the `Context` type for events, allowing the associated action ID to be tracked.

Updated various internal dependencies and build tools.

These changes add new functionality for managing actions, working with agent versions, refreshing access tokens, manipulating sheet fields, handling array cell values, and tracking action-related events. Developers using this SDK should review the updated types and new methods to take advantage of these features in their applications.
