The unique validation and record/cell validity handling has been improved to:

- properly escape field keys containing special characters like periods
- correctly apply the `error` state and appropriate error messages when duplicate values are encountered for fields with a unique constraint
- handle cases where all initially added records have invalid (duplicate) values for fields with a unique constraint
