**Actions are now available on Documents.**

![image](../changelog/images/document_actions_primary.png)

Documents, which are standalone webpages within your Spaces, can now host a variety of actions, just like Workbooks, Sheets, and Files.

Document-Mounted Actions have their own configuration within a Document object. The executable code within an Action is compiled into a Job entity, offering the flexibility to run asynchronously or immediately. This empowers you to create more interactive and dynamic Documents, enhancing the overall user experience within your Flatfile Spaces.

```jsx workbook.js
//your document can now have an action that looks like this
actions: [
  {
    operation: 'sendAction',
    mode: 'foreground',
    label: 'Send to...',
    description: 'Send this page to someone.',
    primary: true,
  },
  {...}
]
```
