        **Actions are now available on Documents.**

        ![image](../changelog/images/document_actions_primary.png)

       Documents, which are standalone webpages within your Spaces, can now host a variety of actions, just like Workbooks, Sheets, and Files.

        Document-Mounted Actions have their own configuration within a Document object. The executable code within an Action is compiled into a Job entity, offering the flexibility to run asynchronously or immediately. This empowers you to create more interactive and dynamic Documents, enhancing the overall user experience within your Flatfile Spaces.

        ```jsx workbook.js
        //your document can now have an action that looks like this
        actions: [
          {
            operation: 'sendAction',
            mode: 'foreground',
            label: 'Send to...',
            description: 'Send this page to someone.',
            primary: true,
          },
          {...}
        ]
        ```
