New fields 'guide' and 'guardrail' have been added to Actions. These options enable providing markdown guidance and warnings to your users.

```
actions: [
  {
    operation: 'submitActionFg',
    mode: 'foreground',
    label: 'Submit For Approval',
    type: 'string',
    description: 'Submit this data to a webhook.',
    primary: true,
    guide: {
        content: "### Personalized Guide \n\n Before performing this Submit For Approval action be sure..."
    },
    guardrail: {
        content: "### Warning! \n\n Before performing this Submit For Approval action did you? ..."
    }
  },
  {...}
],
```

The markdown content of guide will become accessible to the end user via a tooltip on the action element.

The content of the guardrail will be rendered up as a modal warning before the action event is triggered.
