@flatfile/api@1.9.13
The release notes include the following updates:

1. Added a new job type 'app' to generate AI blueprints for an app.
2. Added new fields 'guide' and 'guardrail' to the Action type, representing markdown guidance and guardrails for actions.

For example, the new AiGenerateBlueprintJobConfig type contains spaceId and appId parameters:

```
interface AiGenerateBlueprintJobConfig {
    spaceId: string;
    appId: string; 
}
```

The Action type now has optional 'guide' and 'guardrail' fields of type Guide and Guardrail respectively, where Guide and Guardrail are new types containing markdown content strings.
