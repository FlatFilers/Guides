The release notes include the following changes:

Properly escape composite constraint names when generating unique constraint violation messages. This ensures that constraint names containing special characters are correctly handled and displayed in error messages.

Add a new end-to-end test case to verify that composite constraint violation messages are correctly displayed with the constraint name. This test creates a workbook with a composite constraint on two fields, inserts records that violate the constraint, and asserts that the expected error messages are returned.

No changes to external interfaces or parameters.
