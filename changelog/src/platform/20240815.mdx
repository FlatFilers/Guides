@flatfile/api@1.9.10
The package version has been updated from 1.9.9 to 1.9.10. The `JobOutcomeTriggerAudience` type has been updated to replace the "space" value with "all". This change likely means that job outcome triggers can now target all users in a space, rather than just the originator of the job.
