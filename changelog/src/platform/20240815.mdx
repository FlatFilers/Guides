The "requireAllValidTotal" option has been added for custom actions in the Sheet toolbar.
This new option requires all rows in the Sheet to be valid for the action to be enabled, regardless of selection. 
If "requireAllValidTotal" is set and there are any validation errors in the entire Sheet, the custom action will be disabled with the corresponding tooltip message. 

The existing "requireAllValid" option has been updated to only apply to the selected rows, rather than all rows. 
If "requireAllValid" is set and there are validation errors in the selected rows, the custom action will be disabled with the corresponding tooltip message.
