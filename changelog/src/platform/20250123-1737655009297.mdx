When clearing a column in a job operation, a snapshot of the sheet will be taken
before the column is cleared. This snapshot will be labeled with the specific
column key that is being cleared, providing a record of the sheet state before
the column clearing operation. The snapshot is taken by calling a new utility
function `takeSnapshotForJob`, which handles creating and labeling the snapshot
based on the job, sheet, and column details. This allows developers to review
the sheet state prior to the column clearing if needed.
