We're excited to introduce the new Instructions API, which allows you to store and retrieve contextual instructions for guiding users during the data mapping process.


The Instructions API provides a way to associate helpful guidance with specific field sets. When a user is mapping data with a similar field structure, the appropriate instructions can be retrieved and displayed to guide them through the process.

Key features include:

- **Field-specific instructions**: Store instructions for specific combinations of fields
- **Automatic matching**: Instructions are automatically matched to sheets with similar field structures
- **Metadata support**: Add custom metadata to instructions for additional context
- **Full CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, and delete instructions through a RESTful API

#### Create Instructions

```bash
POST /v1/instructions
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "instructions": "Map the 'email' field to the customer's primary email address.",
  "fieldKeys": ["first", "last", "email", "subscribed", "phone"],
  "metadata": {
    "category": "customer-data"
  }
}
```

#### Get Instructions by Sheet ID

```bash
GET /v1/instructions/sheet/:sheetId
```

#### Update Instructions

```bash
PATCH /v1/instructions/:instructionId
```

#### Delete Instructions

```bash
DELETE /v1/instructions/:instructionId
```

#### How It Works

Instructions are tied to mapping families, which are collections of fields that share a common structure. The system uses a confidence threshold to determine which instructions to display, ensuring that users only see guidance that's relevant to their current data.

#### Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how to create instructions using the API:

```javascript
// Create instructions for customer data fields
fetch('https://api.flatfile.com/v1/instructions?environmentId=us_env_123&scope=us_acc_456', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_secret_key',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    instructions: "Map the 'email' field to the customer's primary email address. The 'first' and 'last' fields should be mapped to the customer's first and last name.",
    fieldKeys: ["first", "last", "email", "subscribed", "phone"],
    metadata: {
      category: "customer-data",
      importance: "high"
    }
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log('Instructions created:', data));
```
