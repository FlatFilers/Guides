**Hide the info Tooltip**

![image](../changelog/images/infotooltip.png)

Within each Space, we've implemented an informative tooltip providing essential details about the Space. This tooltip serves as valuable support for addressing customer inquiries and issues. However, we understand that there are scenarios where you may prefer to hide this information from your customers.

To accommodate your preferences, we've introduced the option to hide this Space tooltip. To make this adjustment, you can utilize the "Update Environment" patch available in our [API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/environments/update-an-environment).

```jsx
metadata: {
  showSpaceInfo: false;
}
```

## core

In this update, we've implemented a crucial enhancement by unifying the casing in our API. We've resolved issues where certain properties were inconsistently cased, which had previously hindered their proper setting and retrieval.

With this unification, you can now seamlessly interact with our API, ensuring a smoother and more reliable experience.

## dataxp

Previously, if an existing value was present in the enum field, you couldn't select a different value from the dropdown. Additionally, when a dropdown field was empty, you were unable to use the dropdown to select a valid option, and typing out an option wasn't possible either. Both of these limitations have now been resolved.
