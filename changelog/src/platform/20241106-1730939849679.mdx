Here are the release notes summarizing the changes:

Created a new AI-powered job for generating and updating validation rules on field configurations. This job utilizes the natural language capabilities of the AI to create new custom validation functions or leverage existing built-in constraints to meet the specified requirements. The job accepts a prompt describing the desired validation rule and produces a configuration that can be applied to a field on a workbook sheet. New constraints generated by the AI will be stored and made available for future use.

Added a limit of 10 constraints per field to prevent excessive constraint configurations. An error will be thrown if a field specifies more than 10 constraints.

Added a validation check to prevent duplicate stored or external constraint validators on a single field. Fields can no longer have multiple instances of the same constraint validator.

Optimized caching for workbooks to include the associated space information, improving performance when retrieving workbooks with their corresponding space details.
