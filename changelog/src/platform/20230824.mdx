**ðŸš€ A Revamped Starting Point**

![image](../changelog/images/get-started.png)

Navigate to your Dashboard's Getting Started page to find an array of new options for effortlessly creating demo spaces. Additionally, we've included the underlying code for each Space, making it straightforward to deconstruct and understand what you're seeing.

**ðŸš€ Major improvements to our queue system**

Weâ€™ve implemented a state-of-the-art technology to substantially enhance the reliability and performance of our queue system. This improvement has a profound impact on the execution of asynchronous tasks, like data validation.

## files

Now, you can set a description for each Option Field value via API.
End users can then view this description as a tooltip during mapping.

## dataxp

We've added new API routes to capture up to 5 snapshots of a Sheet, with the
flexibility to restore any of them using the API at your convenience. Stay
tuned as we prepare to bring this functionality to the UI as well.

## dataxp

A Sheet with no access enabledÂ (`access:[]`)Â now shows a lock icon on the
Sheet tab.

## files

We opted to hide the files count on the Files page if there are no files.

## files

A shrimp size update to the colors of the sidebar toggle so it looks good
with all themes.

## spaces

Info inside `metadata` > `userInfo` will now display in the Spaces list.

## spaces

Metadata allows you to store and retrieve additional data about a Space,
Record, or Field without exposing it to end users. Now, Environments also
have a `metadata` string array.

## spaces

We made a small fix to allow better vertical scrolling in the Dashboard
sidebar.

## dataxp

CTRL + Z wasn't working for a minute. This is now fixed.

## dataxp

If a boolean cell is empty, we only show theÂ toggle on hover now.

## files

We were seeing issues where corrupt files that ran through extraction did
not fail but simply skipped over the lines affected. This is now resolved.
