The following updates have been made:

1. Several package dependencies have been updated to their latest versions, including @nestjs/axios, @nestjs/bullmq, @nestjs/cache-manager, @nestjs/common, @nestjs/core, @nestjs/event-emitter, @nestjs/platform-express, @nestjs/serve-static, @nestjs/terminus, @nestjs/throttler, axios, dd-trace, ioredis, nest-commander, nest-winston, nestjs-ddtrace, nestjs-http-promise, nestjs-request-context, and reflect-metadata.

2. A new package dependency @nest-lab/throttler-storage-redis has been added for Redis-based throttling storage.

3. The `OnEvent` decorator in the `ResourceHierarchyBuilder` has been updated with the `suppressErrors` option set to false.

4. The `OnEvent` decorator in the `WorkbooksService` has been updated with the `suppressErrors` option set to false.

5. The `tsconfig.json` file has been updated to set the `preserveSymlinks` option to true.

6. In the `FronteggService` spec, the `error` logger call has been updated to expect an object as the second argument.

7. In the `DebounceService`, the `getClient` method has been replaced with `getOrThrow` when retrieving the Redis client.

These changes should not significantly impact the external interface or functionality for developers using the package. However, they bring in the latest package versions, improve error handling with the `suppressErrors` option, and enable symlink preservation in the TypeScript configuration.
