**Select Header Row**

We've added a new feature that allows users to select the header row in the data preview. This feature is particularly useful when the first row of your data contains column headers, as it enables you to specify the header row for accurate data mapping.

**Search for Users**

You can now search for users in the manager users page. This feature allows you to quickly find users by name, email, or role, making it easier to manage your user base.

A new view allowing users to "Map Headers" in the mapping flow allows users to select the header row for source data files. This page is displayed after the "Map Fields" page and before the "Map Enums" page.
