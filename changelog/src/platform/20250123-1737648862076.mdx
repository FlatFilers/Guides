The release notes include the following updates:

A new filter option has been added to the `buildBaseResolutionsQuery` function to exclude resolved conflicts. If the `filterConflicts` parameter is provided as `true`, the query will additionally filter out any resolved conflicts where the `resolveTo` property is not null. This allows developers to focus on retrieving only the unresolved conflicts. For example:

```typescript
const query = buildBaseResolutionsQuery({
  filterConflicts: true,
  filterColumn: 'title',
  pageSize: 10,
  pageNumber: 1,
});
```
