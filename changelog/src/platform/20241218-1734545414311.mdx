The release notes for this update are:

The `@langchain` dependencies have been updated to their latest versions. The `@langchain/anthropic` package has been updated to version 0.3.8, `@langchain/aws` has been added at version 0.1.2, `@langchain/community` has been updated to version 0.3.17, `@langchain/core` has been updated to version 0.3.20, and `@langchain/openai` has been added at version 0.3.14. The `langchain` package itself has been updated to version 0.3.6.

The `BedrockModel` has been updated to use the `ChatBedrockConverse` class from the `@langchain/aws` package instead of the `BedrockChat` class from the `@langchain/community` package. This change includes updates to how the model is instantiated and invoked.

The `AnthropicModel` has been updated to handle additional models with larger token limits (8192 tokens for models containing "3-5-haiku" or "claude-3-5-sonnet" in their names).

The `ChatPromptTemplate.fromPromptMessages` method has been renamed to `ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages` across the codebase.

The `JsonObject` type import from `langchain/tools` has been removed in the `BillingService`.

Example usage:

```typescript
import { ChatBedrockConverse } from '@langchain/aws';

const model = new ChatBedrockConverse({
  model: 'mistral.mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0:1',
  region: process.env['AWS_REGION'],
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
    secretAccessKey: process.env['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'],
  },
  temperature: 0.7, // model-specific parameter
  maxTokens: 4096,
});
```
