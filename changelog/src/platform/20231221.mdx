     **Enhanced Theming Tabs, Tooltips, and Popovers**

       We're excited to announce a broad range of new theming capabilities that enhance the visual appeal and customization of our platform:

      **Usage**

      ```jsx
      {
        "theme": {
          "root": {
            "borderColor": "pink",
            "modalBorderRadius": "10px",
            "popoverBorderRadius": "8px",
            "tabstripActiveColor": "deepskyblue",
            "tabstripInactiveColor": "orange",
            "popoverBackgroundColor": "limegreen",
            "tabstripHoverTextColor": "gold",
            "tooltipBackgroundColor": "hotpink",
            "tabstripHoverBorderColor": "purple"
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      1. Theming for Tabs: Customize the look and feel of tabs to better match your application's design and user experience.

      2. Enhanced Tooltip Styling: Gain more control over tooltip aesthetics with expanded theming options, ensuring they align seamlessly with your interface.

      3. Refined Borders Across Components: Apply custom themes to borders, providing a sharper and more cohesive visual distinction for various elements.
      4. Popover Customization: Tailor the appearance of popovers with new theming capabilities, enhancing their integration within your application's layout.

      5. Modal Window Styling: Elevate the design of modal windows with customizable theming options, contributing to a more engaging and harmonious user experience.

      These updates offer a greater degree of flexibility in customizing the appearance of key UI components, allowing for a more integrated and visually consistent application design.
