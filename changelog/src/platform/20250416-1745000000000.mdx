**Enhanced Data Clips with Anonymous Guest Link Support**

We've improved the Data Clips feature with anonymous guest link sharing capabilities:

- Added support for anonymous guest access to Data Clips via shareable links
- Updated the Data Clip sharing modal with a new access dropdown to control link visibility
- Added options to set access as "Restricted" (collaborators only) or "Anyone with the link"
- Improved the UI for collaborator selection with a more intuitive multi-select interface
- Automatically synchronizes URL tokens when viewing shared Data Clips
- Enhanced security with proper authentication token handling for guest access

This update makes it easier to share specific data subsets with external stakeholders without requiring them to create Flatfile accounts, streamlining collaboration workflows.
