## Warning messages on outliers

We've enhanced the outlier detection system with structured warning messages that provide clearer, more actionable feedback when mapping issues are detected.

### Key Features

- **Structured Warning Types** - Four specific categories of mapping issues:
  - `UNMAPPED_FIELD` - Source field has no mapped destination fields
  - `TOO_MANY_FIELDS` - Too many destination fields for efficient permutation checking
  - `CONTENT_MISMATCH` - Character length mismatch between source and destinations
  - `ORDER_MISMATCH` - Field order issues preventing successful mapping

- **Multiple Warning Detection** - System can detect and report multiple issues with a single mapping.

- **Detailed Diagnostic Data** - Each warning includes:
  - Source field name and value
  - Destination field names and values
  - Normalized values for comparison
  - Field counts and limits
  - Content comparison metrics

- **User-Friendly Messaging** - Simple, consistent message format for each warning type

When hovering over a field with a warning indicator (yellow triangle), you'll now see specific information about what type of issue exists, making it easier to understand and resolve mapping problems.
