        **Improved copy-paste experience while bulk selecting cells**

        We've enhanced the bulk selection experience by enabling paste functionality. When you paste, we simply transition you out of the selection state, similar to when editing. Note: if you paste without selecting any cells, the operation will automatically apply to the bulk-selected rows.
