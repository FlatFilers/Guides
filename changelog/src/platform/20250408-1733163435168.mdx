**Advanced Filters with Field Validation Status**

We've enhanced our filtering capabilities with a new Advanced Filters feature that supports querying by field validation status. This powerful addition allows you to build dynamic filters that combine field selection with validation checks.

Key improvements include:

- Support for the FFQL `is` operator with values of `error` and `valid`
- Ability to create complex filters targeting specific fields with validation issues
- User-friendly interface for building advanced filter queries
- Seamless integration with existing filtering capabilities

For example, you can now easily find all records where a specific field (like "email") has validation errors, or combine this with other conditions to create precise filters for your data cleanup workflows.

This feature is particularly useful for data quality management, allowing you to quickly identify and address problematic fields across your datasets.
