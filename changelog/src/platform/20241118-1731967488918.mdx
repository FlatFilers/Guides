Added mutation hooks to create, update, and delete constraints for the application.
Added a new "Your Constraints" section in the constraints list to separate custom constraints from global library constraints.
Updated the constraint fields panel to include a tabbed view with options to edit the constraint name, configuration, and function code.
Added the ability to save changes to constraint names and function code.
Removed some unused styles and components.
Updated the rule editor to display the constraint name and provide a link to edit the constraint.
Removed the "Save Changes" button from the rule editor since changes are now saved automatically.
Refactored the constraint operations to use the new mutation hooks and handle creating, updating, and deleting constraints through the API.
