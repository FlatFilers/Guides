The release notes include updates to the XLSX Extractor, JSON Extractor, and XML Extractor agents. The `link` property for each of these agents has been updated to point to the corresponding plugin documentation page on flatfile.com/plugins. For example, the XLSX Extractor agent's `link` property now points to `https://flatfile.com/plugins/plugin-xlsx-extractor` instead of the previous documentation URL. This change allows developers to more easily access the relevant plugin documentation when working with these agents.
