**🚀 4 New Example Spaces**

Visit the **Getting Started** page on your Dashboard to discover four new
options for effortlessly generating demo spaces:

1. Namespaces
2. Metadata
3. Egress
4. Sidebar Customization

Similar to the rest of the options, we've provided the underlying code for each
Space, simplifying the process of breaking down and comprehending the elements
on display.

## core

**Authentication Query Enhancement**

The authentication query has been streamlined for optimized performance.
Extensive benchmarking has revealed that this refinement contributes to a
reduction of approximately 20 milliseconds for each request. This enhancement
results in faster overall processing and improved response times.

The **Data Checklist** now includes data types that correspond to each field.
Additionally, the searchable dropdowns are now more user friendly.

## core

A pagination logic issue concerning **Environments** has been resolved. The
correction ensures accurate calculation of the number of pages and consistent
delivery of valid responses in accordance with the
[Pagination](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/api/1dcb99aada63f-pagination)
type.

Furthermore, the default page size for **Spaces** has been set to 10, aligning
it with the specifications outlined in the API documentation.

Previously, attempting to navigate into a dropdown using the keyboard's tab key
was unresponsive. This issue has been addressed, and tabbing via keyboard now
smoothly activates dropdowns, accompanied by a focus outline for the custom
trigger.

## core

The API specification has been updated to facilitate the mapping of `enum`
values of various types such as `string`, `integer`, or `boolean`. This
modification effectively resolves a server error response that was previously
encountered when utilizing such `enum` values within the API.

In addition, the loading state of the "Continue" button has been refined to
ensure smooth recovery from server errors. This adjustment enhances the overall
user experience by providing more graceful handling of unexpected issues during
the process.
