      The API specification has been updated to facilitate the mapping of `enum` values of various types such as `string`, `integer`, or `boolean`. This modification effectively resolves a server error response that was previously encountered when utilizing such `enum` values within the API.

      In addition, the loading state of the "Continue" button has been refined to ensure smooth recovery from server errors. This adjustment enhances the overall user experience by providing more graceful handling of unexpected issues during the process.
