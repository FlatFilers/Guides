The background color for warning cells has been changed to a lighter shade by using the --colors-warning-20 variable instead of --colors-warning-80. The border color for warning cells has also been updated to use the --colors-warning-90 variable instead of --colors-warning-100. These changes make the warning cells appear less prominent and potentially less attention-grabbing within the user interface.
