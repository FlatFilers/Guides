        **New: At-a-glance Insights are now available in the Sidebar**

        ![image](../changelog/images/sidebar-counts.gif)

        Enhancements to the Spaces sidebar now offer at-a-glance insights for greater efficiency: each workbook's entry displays a count of contained Sheets, alongside a tally of records within each Sheet. Additionally, the validity of records is intuitively indicated with color-coded dots—green for valid and red for invalid—directly within the Sheet summary. This allows for quick identification and management of data accuracy.
