The extraction logic now includes row and field count metadata in the extraction result. Specifically, the `rowCount` property has been added to represent the total number of rows in the extracted data, and the `fieldCount` property represents the number of fields or columns in the extracted data. This change provides developers using the package with more detailed information about the size and structure of the extracted data.
