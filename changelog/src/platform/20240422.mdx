       **Improved Duplicate Field Key Validation in Workbook Sheets**

      **Case-Insensitive Checking**: Our latest update enhances the validation process by identifying duplicate field keys in workbook sheets, including case-insensitive comparisons. This ensures that field keys are unique regardless of character casing, maintaining data integrity and consistency across your datasets.

      **Data Integrity Assurance**: By preventing the entry of duplicate keys, even when differences are only in letter casing, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of data processing within our application.
