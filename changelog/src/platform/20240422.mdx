**Improved Duplicate Field Key Validation in Workbook Sheets**

**Case-Insensitive Checking**:

Our latest update enhances the validation process by identifying duplicate field
keys in workbook sheets, including case-insensitive comparisons. This ensures
that field keys are unique regardless of character casing, maintaining data
integrity and consistency across your datasets.

**Data Integrity Assurance**:

By preventing the entry of duplicate keys, even when differences are only in
letter casing, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of data processing within
our application.
