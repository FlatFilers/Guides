**Multiple Sheet Support for Data Extractor**

We've enhanced the data extraction capabilities with support for multiple sheets:

- Data extractor now identifies and processes multiple tables from source files
- New tabbed interface allows users to navigate between extracted sheets
- Each sheet is displayed with its own preview table and controls
- Sheet names are automatically generated based on the source data structure
- Users can select which sheets to import during the extraction process

**UI Improvements**

- Fixed a blank rendering issue in the extractor preview component
- Added new SheetTabs component suite for intuitive sheet navigation
- Improved error handling for empty or malformed sheets
- Enhanced the overall extraction workflow with clearer progress indicators

This update significantly improves the experience when working with multi-sheet files like Excel workbooks, providing more control and visibility into the extraction process.
