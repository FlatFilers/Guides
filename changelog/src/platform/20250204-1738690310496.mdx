api@a372b5a The release includes the following updates:

Records with readonly configurations are now handled differently in the
replaceRecords operation. A new option called excludeReadOnly has been
introduced to control whether readonly records or fields should be skipped or
replaced. If excludeReadOnly is set to true, records with a readonly config or
fields marked as readonly will not be replaced during the replaceRecords
operation. If excludeReadOnly is false or not provided, readonly records and
fields will be replaced as before.

The findAndReplaceRecords method in the WorkbooksService now checks if the field
being replaced is readonly and throws an error if excludeReadOnly is set to
true, preventing modification of readonly fields.

Several new tests have been added to validate the behavior of the replaceRecords
operation with readonly records and fields, covering scenarios with
excludeReadOnly set to true and false.

The SearchRecordsOptions and GetCellValuesOptions interfaces have been updated
to include the new excludeReadOnly option.

Example usage:

```typescript
// Replace non-readonly records or fields
const records = await wb.op.replaceRecords({
  sheetId: wb.contacts.id,
  options: {},
  find: "John",
  replace: "Jonathan",
  field: { key: "firstName" },
  legacyReplace: false,
  actorId: UserId.make(),
});

// Skip readonly records or fields
const records = await wb.op.replaceRecords({
  sheetId: wb.contacts.id,
  options: { excludeReadOnly: true },
  find: "John",
  replace: "Jonathan",
  field: { key: "firstName" },
  legacyReplace: false,
  actorId: UserId.make(),
});
```
