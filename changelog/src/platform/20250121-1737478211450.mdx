The release notes summarize the following updates:

The ActionButton component now supports displaying a tooltip when the button is disabled or active. The tooltip content is determined based on whether the button is locked or unlocked, and whether it is disabled or active. If the button is locked and disabled, the tooltip will display the lockedTooltip.disabled text. If the button is unlocked and disabled, the tooltip will display the tooltip.disabled text. If the button is locked and active, the tooltip will display the lockedTooltip.active text. If the button is unlocked and active, the tooltip will display the tooltip.active text. The tooltip is implemented using the AMP_TOOLTIP_ID data attribute and the data-tooltip-content attribute. This change allows developers to provide more informative feedback to users about the state and functionality of the ActionButton.

Additionally, the loading state functionality for the ActionButton component has been updated. Previously, there was a comment indicating that the loading state implementation was incomplete. The updated code now includes the loading prop, which can be used to display a loading indicator when the button is in a loading state.
