In this update, the FirstLoginModal component now includes tracking functionality using the useTracking and useIdentity hooks. When the user navigates to the /demo page from the FirstLoginModal, the capture function is called with the /demo route and the user's email as properties. This allows tracking of user interactions and capturing relevant data during the first login flow. Developers using this package can now easily integrate tracking capabilities within their application by leveraging the provided hooks and capture function.
