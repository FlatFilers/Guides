Updated the AutoBuild flow to allow editing the working space name during the build process. The name can now be edited by clicking an icon next to the space name, which reveals an input field to enter a new name. The name change is saved when the input field loses focus or the Enter key is pressed. Added a badge indicating "Dev Mode" when not in the production environment.

Simplified the loading step by removing the detailed progress indicators and showing only a centered loader component.

Updated the BlueprintTab component to display a bottom border and align the blueprint view action icons to the right.
