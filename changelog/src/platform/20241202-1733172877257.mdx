The release notes include the following updates:

The useCollection hook for fetching users now accepts pageNumber and pageSize parameters to enable pagination. This means developers using the package can now paginate the list of users, with a default page size of 15.

The pagination state and functionality have been extracted into a separate pagination object, which is passed as a prop to components that require pagination functionality. This includes currentPage, setCurrentPage, pageCount, and setPageCount properties, allowing for easy management of pagination state and behavior.

The search functionality has been enhanced with the introduction of the useDebounce hook, which debounces the search value input for 500 milliseconds before triggering a search. This optimization improves performance by reducing unnecessary searches for each keystroke. For example:

```tsx
const debouncedSearchValue = useDebounce<string | undefined>(searchValue, 500)
```

Overall, these changes improve the user experience by adding pagination and optimizing the search functionality, while also making the code more modular and reusable.
