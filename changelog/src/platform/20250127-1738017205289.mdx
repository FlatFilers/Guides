The release notes include the following updates:

Added a new hook `useMonitorRecordMutations` to monitor the status of record mutations (add, update, delete) for a given workbook. This hook returns two arrays: `pendingMutations` and `failedMutations`, allowing components to react accordingly.

Updated the `useWorkbookHasCommits` hook to use `useMonitorRecordMutations` instead of directly checking for active mutations using `useIsMutating`. This change improves the accuracy of detecting pending and failed mutations.

Updated the `WorkbookCountsContext` to utilize `useMonitorRecordMutations` for setting the `isFetching` state based on pending and failed mutations. When there are pending mutations, `isFetching` is set to true for the current sheet. When all mutations are completed (either successful or failed), `isFetching` is set to false.

Added a `gcTime` option to the `useRecordMutation` hook, which sets the time after which a mutation is garbage collected. This option is set to 100ms for add, update, and delete record mutations.

Improved the handling of expected commits in the `useWorkbookHasCommits` hook. If there are failed mutations and no pending mutations, the expected commit state is cleared.
