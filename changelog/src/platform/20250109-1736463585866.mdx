The release notes include the following updates:

A new PATCH /v1/data-clips/:dataClipId/refresh-resolutions endpoint has been added to refresh the resolutions for a given data clip. This will update the resolution table to reflect the latest changes made to the clip records. It requires the 'data-clip:update' privilege.

When refreshing resolutions, a new 'data-clip:resolutions-refreshed' event is emitted, allowing consumers to subscribe to this event topic to be notified of resolution refreshes.

The behavior of the data clip status transition from READY to OPEN has been updated. It no longer unlocks the associated clip sheet when transitioning from READY to OPEN.

The behavior when creating resolutions for a data clip has been updated. It no longer locks the associated clip sheet when creating resolutions.

These changes provide a way for consumers to refresh data clip resolutions on-demand and be notified of resolution refreshes. They also update the behavior around locking/unlocking the clip sheet during certain state transitions.
