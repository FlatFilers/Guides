The translation strings have been updated to include a new error message for when an import source file cannot be located. The "lockedIconTooltip" string has also been added for locked sheets.

A new "files.queries.ts" file has been added with queries related to retrieving files. The "flatfileQuery.ts" file has been updated to include the new files queries.

Mock data for file queries has been added in "files.mocks.ts".

The "SheetTabs" component has been updated to use the "getSheet" query instead of relying on the workbook's sheet data. It now renders a locked icon for locked sheets.

The "SheetView" component has been updated to handle locked sheets and to show the locked icon.

The "useSheetFile" hook has been updated to determine if a workbook is a file or connection based on treatments and labels. It now uses the "getFiles" query to retrieve import files and navigate to the import page. The hook no longer relies on the "FileController" and "useObservable".

The "ReadOnly" component has been updated to render a different icon and tooltip for locked sheets.

The "SidebarSheetItem" component has been updated to use the "getSheet" query and to show the locked icon for locked sheets.

The "useSheetAccess" hook has been updated to handle locked sheets and return the appropriate access values.

Overall, these changes introduce support for handling locked sheets, improve the handling of import files, and update various components and hooks to use React Query for data fetching.
