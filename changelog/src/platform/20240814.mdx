@flatfile/api@1.9.9
The release notes for this update are:

The version of the SDK has been updated from 1.9.8 to 1.9.9. The type `JobOutcomeTrigger` has been changed to be a union of `JobOutcomeTriggerType` and `JobOutcomeTriggerDetails`. A new type `JobOutcomeTriggerDetails` has been introduced which contains a `type` field of type `JobOutcomeTriggerType` and an optional `audience` field of type `JobOutcomeTriggerAudience`. The `JobOutcomeTriggerAudience` enum has also been added with values "originator" and "space" to represent for whom the job outcome's next effect should be triggered automatically.
