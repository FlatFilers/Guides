**Introducing the Flatfile Dedicated Mapping APIs**

We’re excited to announce the launch of the Flatfile Dedicated Mapping API, a significant enhancement to our suite of tools. This new API, encapsulated within a user-friendly Python library, is designed to fully harness Flatfile’s mapping capabilities. It provides a robust solution for mapping schemas directly within your systems, ensuring that your data remains secure in your database. This API is ideal for a range of applications, from data pipelines and API integrations to complex data conversion workflows.

The essence of mapping with this API is the transformation of source records into target records. This process ranges from straightforward tasks like renaming fields (for example, changing “first_name” to “firstName”) to more complex operations such as extracting substrings from fields or concatenating multiple fields.

Our Mapping API and accompanying Python library bring forth new opportunities for efficient and precise data mapping, offering customization to meet your unique needs and workflow requirements.

To get started, refer to the [README](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-mapping).
