The release notes include the following updates:

Inngest queue driver is now supported as a new queue driver option. To use the Inngest queue driver, set `QUEUE_DRIVER=INNGEST` and configure the necessary Inngest environment variables (`INNGEST_WEBHOOK_PORT`, `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`, `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`, `INNGEST_BASE_URL`, and `INNGEST_DEV`). When using the Inngest queue driver, an Express server is started to handle Inngest webhooks, and any registered Inngest functions are served at the `/api/inngest` endpoint.

The cache URL configuration has been updated. Instead of using a separate `CACHE_URL` environment variable, it now defaults to `redis://localhost:6380`, which is configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The `inngest` and `nest-inngest` packages have been added as dependencies.
