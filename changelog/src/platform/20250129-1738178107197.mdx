The release notes include the following updates:

The functionality to automatically create an agent for autobuild has been removed. This change likely simplifies the autobuild setup process for developers using the package.

The `disableNamespace` prop has been removed from the `UpdateAppForm` component. This change allows developers to update the namespace of the app when deploying via the autobuild flow.
