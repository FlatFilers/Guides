The release note summarizes the following changes:

The `continueOnSuccess` function has been updated to replace the browser history state with the destination URL instead of navigating away from the current page. This ensures that the user's browser history is updated correctly and they can use the back button to navigate back to the previous page. Additionally, the function now fetches the workbook counts after navigating to the destination URL. This allows for updating the UI with the latest workbook data when the user arrives at the destination page. The change provides a better user experience and ensures data consistency across pages.
