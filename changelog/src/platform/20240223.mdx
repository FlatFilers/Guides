**Optimized Space Loading Series: Reduced Requests for Translations**

We've streamlined the loading process for Spaces by eliminating an unnecessary request for translations that previously triggered an additional getSpaceById call. This refinement reduces the load time, ensuring Spaces are displayed more promptly for a smoother user experience.

**New: Advanced Column Filtering Feature**

Beyond the existing functionalities of sorting, replacing empty values, and conducting searches within fields, we’ve now integrated a precise value filtering option for columns. This new feature includes a convenient search mechanism to effortlessly pinpoint and filter by the specific value you’re seeking. Streamline your data analysis and management with this robust filtering capability.

**Enhanced Data Mapping Consistency with user created custom fields**

In our continuous efforts to streamline data import processes, we've implemented an improvement targeting the scenario where mapping rules from previous imports include destination fields no longer present in the current schema. This situation can arise if a custom field was added during a past import session and the data being imported is from a completely new sheet, often observed in embedded imports. With this update, we ensure a smoother data mapping experience by automatically filtering out rules that do not match the current destination blueprint, maintaining consistency and accuracy in your data integration efforts.
