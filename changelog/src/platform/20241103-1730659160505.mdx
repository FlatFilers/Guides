This release introduces a new endpoint `/v2-alpha/workbooks/bulk-create` that allows you to create multiple workbooks in a single request, sharing a common base configuration. The endpoint accepts a `config` object with the base configuration for the workbooks, and an array of `workbooks` objects with overrides for individual workbook properties. The key features are:

You can specify a base configuration for sheets, actions, settings, metadata, and treatments to be shared across all created workbooks.

Individual workbooks can override properties like name, namespace, labels, metadata, settings, and treatments from the base configuration.

The endpoint supports creating workbooks silently without emitting `workbook:created` events.

It gracefully handles failures during bulk creation, returning a list of results indicating success or failure for each workbook, along with any errors.

The endpoint returns 400 if the required `config` or `workbooks` array is missing, and 404 if the specified `spaceId` does not exist.

Example request body:
```json
{
  "spaceId": "dev_sp_123",
  "config": {
    "name": "Base Workbook",
    "sheets": [
      {
        "name": "Sheet 1",
        "slug": "sheet-1",
        "fields": [
          {"key": "name", "type": "string", "label": "Name"},
          {"key": "email", "type": "string", "label": "Email"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "workbooks": [
    {
      "name": "Overridden Workbook 1",
      "namespace": "namespace-1",
      "labels": ["label-1"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Overridden Workbook 2",
      "namespace": "namespace-2",
      "settings": {"trackChanges": true}
    }
  ]
