**Updated `ListDocumentsResponse`**

The `data` property now returns an array of `Document` objects instead of the
previous `DocumentResponse`. This change standardizes the format and improves
consistency in how document data is handled.

**Enhanced Job Configuration**

We added a new `predecessorIds` property to `JobConfig`. This property allows
you to specify job dependencies, meaning you can list the IDs of jobs that must
be completed before the current job can start. This helps in managing and
sequencing job execution more effectively.

We added a new feature to handle job outcomes more effectively with a new type
called `JobOutcomeNext` and its variant files. This includes:

- `JobOutcomeNextFileObject` Stores individual file information with an ID and
  optional label.
- `JobOutcomeNextFiles` Handles multiple files, including an array of
  JobOutcomeNextFileObject instances and an optional label.

We also added a waiting value to the JobStatus enum to indicate when a job is
paused or pending, improving job processing workflows.

**Enhanced Views Request and Response**

We updated `ListViewsRequest` to include optional `pageSize` and `pageNumber`
properties, allowing for pagination when retrieving views. We've also added a
`createdBy` property to `View` and `ViewResponse` to track the creator of each
view.
