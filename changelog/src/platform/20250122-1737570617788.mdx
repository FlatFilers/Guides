In this release:

The AssistantModule now imports the MarkFieldRequiredTask and exports it. A new task MarkFieldRequiredTask is introduced to mark a field as required or not required in a sheet. The task can be used to update the constraints of a field to include or remove the 'required' constraint.

A new endpoint /internal/tools/mark-field-required is added to the BFFController. This endpoint accepts a sheetId, fieldKey, and a boolean required value. It creates a job to run the MarkFieldRequiredTask with the provided parameters.

The JobsModule now imports the MarkFieldRequiredTask. The JobsResource and JobsService are updated to handle the new job operation AIRunTool which runs the MarkFieldRequiredTask.

A new job logic AIRunToolLogic is introduced to handle the AIRunTool job operation. It executes the MarkFieldRequiredTask and updates the job status accordingly.

The WorkbooksService now includes a new method upsertField to update an existing field in a sheet. It is used by the MarkFieldRequiredTask to update the field constraints.

Example usage:

```typescript
// Mark the 'email' field as required
const response = await fetch('/v1/internal/tools/mark-field-required', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    sheetId: 'sheet_abc123',
    fieldKey: 'email',
    required: true
  })
});
const { data } = await response.json();
const { jobId } = data;

// Check job status
const job = await fetch(`/v1/jobs/${jobId}`);
```
