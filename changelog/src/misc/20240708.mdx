        `@flatfile/art@0.0.1`

        This release includes multiple ASCII art additions to the @flatfile/art package. The flower art and music art have been added as new functions, printFlowerArt and printMusicArt respectively. These functions print ASCII art representations of a flower and musical notes to the console. The art array in the index file has been updated to include these new functions, allowing them to be randomly printed along with the existing dino art. To use these new ASCII art prints, import the package and call the callRandomArtFunction(). For example:

```
import { callRandomArtFunction } from '@flatfile/art';

callRandomArtFunction();
```

This will randomly print one of the ASCII art pieces to the console, which could be the new flower or music art added in this release. No additional parameters or configuration is needed.
