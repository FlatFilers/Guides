The `@flatfile/plugin-export-workbook` version 5.0.0 introduces two significant enhancements to Excel file exports:

1. Origin Control
- New `origin` option allows specifying where data begins in the Excel sheet
- Configure starting row and column positions
- Useful for leaving space for headers or additional content

2. Column Header Customization
- Added `columnHeaders` configuration options
- Control header content (field keys vs labels)
- Customize header styling (bold, background color, etc.)

These changes provide greater flexibility in formatting exported Excel files to match specific requirements.
