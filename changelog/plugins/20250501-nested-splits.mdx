# Nested Splits Support

**May 1, 2025**

We're excited to announce support for nested splits in Flatfile's data transformation capabilities. This feature enhances the platform's ability to handle complex data transformations by tracking mapping rules server-side and enabling reference to previewed data in agent tool calls.

## Key Improvements

- **Server-side mapping rules**: Mapping rules are now tracked server-side, allowing for more complex transformations
- **Previewed data reference**: Agent tool calls can now reference data that has been previewed through previous transformations
- **Enhanced split functionality**: The split tool now supports nested operations where one split can build upon another
- **Improved data transformation workflow**: Create multi-stage data transformations with preserved context

## Use Cases

Nested splits are particularly useful for:

- Complex address parsing (splitting an address into components, then further splitting those components)
- Name parsing with multiple levels of detail
- Date and time processing with hierarchical transformations
- Any scenario requiring sequential, dependent data transformations

## Implementation

The nested splits functionality is available through the preprocessing service and can be accessed using the split tool. For detailed implementation guidance, see our [Nested Splits guide](/learning-center/guides/nested-splits).

This enhancement significantly expands Flatfile's data transformation capabilities, enabling more sophisticated data processing workflows that were previously difficult to implement.
