Flatfile Spaces are micro-applications, each having their own database, filestore, and auth. 
Use Spaces to integrate Flatfile into your data exchange workflow, whether that happens directly 
in your application or as part of a currently offline process. 

With Spaces, you can:
1. Run Flatfile from an "Import" button in your web application
2. Launch data onboarding projects
3. Collect and process files from feeds

## Reference

A Space is comprised of Workbooks, Files, Users, Documents, Themes and Metadata.

## Reference

#### `Workbooks` *object*
A Space contains any number of Workbooks. Each <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Workbooks">[Workbook](docs.com)</Tooltip> is a Blueprint-defined database.

```jsx  
idk what to put here...
```

<Note>You can define a primary Workbook for any Space, and that Workbook will always remain at the top of the list.</Note>

#### `Files` *object*
Files are uploaded directly to a Space.

```jsx  
idk what to put here...
```

#### `Users` *object*
By default, all global Admins in Flatfile have access to all Spaces. Additionally, you can configure a Space to allow for either temporary (`shared_link`) or named (`magic_link`) Guest Users.

```jsx  
"guestAuthentication": [
    "magic_link"
  ]
```

#### `Documents` *object*
Documents are custom pages that are mounted on the Space and display in the sidebar of a Space in the order of their addition to the Space. 

```jsx  
idk what to put here
```

#### `Theme` *object*
Theming of Flatfile is controlled at the Space level. A comprehensive list of Theme options is available here.

```jsx  
idk what to put there
```

#### `Metadata` *object*
Spaces can be created and updated with Metadata. This could include a company-specific identifier such as a UUID for use in API operations in the Space.

```jsx  
idk what to put there
```
