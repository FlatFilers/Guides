In Flatfile, a Job represents a large unit of work performed asynchronously on a resource
such as a file, Workbook, or Sheet. The Jobs workflow provides visibility into the status
and progress of your Jobs, allowing you to monitor and troubleshoot
the data processing pipeline.

For example, a Job could represent:
- a data export
- a remapping of data from one sheet to another
- an action in the UI that triggers a Job

#### Types of Jobs

There are 4 types of Jobs:

1. Extracting data from a file (moving data from a file to a workbook)
2. Mapping data from one workbook to another (moving data from a workbook to a Workbook)
3. Deleting data from a Workbook (operating on data in a single Workbook)
4. Exporting data from a Workbook

All of these operate on (potentially) large amounts of data and complete asynchronously;
you donâ€™t want to wait around for them, so we notify you when they're done.

## The Anatomy of a Job

Flatfile Jobs follow a standard structure:

- `type` - Workbook, file, Sheet
- `operation` - export, extract, map, delete
- `source` - id for the data source
- `destination?` - id for the data target (if any)
- `config` - a configuration object specific to the operation
- `trigger` - manual or immediate

In addition, Jobs track their execution state with:

- `status` - PLANNING, READY, EXECUTING, COMPLETED, FAILED
- `parts` - how many parts the Job was broken into
- `processed` - how many of those parts have been processed so far

## Using Jobs

An action in the UI can trigger a Job by POST-ing to the `/jobs` API endpoint.
If the `trigger` is `immediate` the Job will run immediately;
otherwise it can be triggered with a POST to the `/jobs/:id/execute` endpoint.

## Job Lifecycle Events

Jobs emit the following events throughout their lifecycle that you can listen for:

- `job:waiting` - emitted after a Job is created but before it begins executing
- `job:started` - emitted right before a Job starts execution
- `job:updated` - emitted when a Job's progress is updated
- `job:failed` - emitted when a Job has failed
- `job:completed` - emitted when a Job has completed successfully
- `job:deleted` - emitted when a Job has been deleted

## Building with Jobs

How you build your UI is up to you, but here is one possibility:

1. Create a component that is used to trigger a Job
2. When the Job is triggered, POST to the `/jobs` endpoint
3. When the Job is complete, the server will send a `job:completed` event
4. When the `job:completed` event is received, update the UI to reflect the new state
