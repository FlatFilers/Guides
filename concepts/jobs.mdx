In Flatfile, a Job represents a large unit of work performed asynchronously on a resource
such as a file, <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](../concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip>,
or <Tooltip tip="A collection of fields...">[Sheet](../blueprint/overview#terms)</Tooltip>.
The Jobs workflow provides visibility into the status and progress of your Jobs,
allowing you to monitor and troubleshoot the data processing pipeline.

## Types of Jobs

Jobs can be triggered in a number of ways, most commonly in response to user activity.
Jobs are then managed via [Listeners](/concepts/listeners), which receive [Events](/concepts/events) published by Flatfile in response to activity.

There are three types of Jobs on the Flatfile Platform:

1. [Action](#action-based-jobs)
2. [Custom](#custom-jobs)
3. [System](#system-jobs)

### Action Based Jobs

Actions are developer-defined operations that can be mounted on a number of domains (including Sheets, Workbooks, Documents, and Files). Mounting an Action means attaching a custom operation to that domain. That operation can then be triggered by a user event in the UI (they can appear as buttons or as menu items) or by a custom event in your code.

When an Action is triggered in the UI by a user the `job:ready` Event for a Job named `{domain}:{operation}` is published. Your Listener can then be configured to respond to the action.

To run an Action based job, two configurations are necessary.

First, create an [Action](/concepts/actions) on a domain. Here's an example of a Workbook containing an Action:

```jsx javascript
api.workbook.create({
  name: "October Report Workbook",
  actions: [
    {
      label: "Export Data",
      description: "Send data to destination system",
      operation: "export",
      type: "file",
    },
  ],
});
```

Then, create a [Listener](/concepts/listeners) to respond to the Action:

```jsx javascript
listener.on(
  "job:ready",
  { job: "workbook:export" },
  ({ context: { jobId } }, payload) => {
    const { jobId } = event.context;

    try {
        await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
          info: "Starting submit job...",
          progress: 10,
        });

        // Custom code here

        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            message: "Submit job was completed succesfully.",
          },
        });

    } catch (error) {
        await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            message: "This job failed.",
          },
        });
    }
  }
);
```

Note that the Listener is listening for the `job:ready` event, for the `workbook:export` Job, which was defined in our Workbook.

### Custom Jobs

Another trigger option is to create a Custom Job via SDK/API. In the SDK, Jobs are created by calling the `api.jobs.create()` method.

Creating a custom Job in your Listener enables any Event to trigger a Job.

Here's an example of creating a custom Job in a Listener:

```jsx javascript
listener.on(
  "commit:created",
  { sheet: "Contacts" },
  async ({ context: { workbookId, sheetId } }) => {
    const { data } = await api.jobs.create({
      type: "workbook",
      operation: "delete-records",
      trigger: "immediate",
      source: workbookId,
      config: {
        sheet: sheetId,
        filter: "all",
      },
    });
  }
);
```

<Warning>
  Please note that Flatfile does not support job plans for custom actions.
</Warning>

### System Jobs

Internally, Flatfile uses Jobs to power many of the features of the Flatfile Platform, such as extraction, record mutation, and AI Assist.
Here are some examples of Jobs that the Flatfile Platform creates and manages on your behalf:

| Job Name      | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extract       | Extracts data from the specified source.                      |
| Map           | Maps data from it's ingress format to Blueprint fields.       |
| DeleteRecords | Deletes records from a dataset based on specified criteria.   |
| Export        | Exports data to a specified format or destination.            |
| MutateRecords | Alters records in a dataset according to defined rules.       |
| Configure     | Sets up or modifies the configuration of a Space.             |
| AiAssist      | Utilizes AI to assist with tasks such as data categorization. |
| FindReplace   | Searches for specific values and replaces them.               |

## The Anatomy of a Job

### Status

A Job's status can be used to track and handle a Job. The status of a Job can be one of the following:

| Status    | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Created   | The initial status when a job is created.                                           |
| Ready     | A job is prepared to execute.                                                       |
| Executing | The job has been acknowledged by a Listener and is now executing.                   |
| Completed | The job has been completed.                                                         |
| Failed    | The job encountered an error during execution and can't complete its assigned task. |
| Canceled  | The job has been cancelled                                                          |

### Lifecycle Events

Jobs fire the following Events during their lifecycle. In chronological order, the Job Events are:

| Event                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `job:created`                   | Fires when a job is created, but before it does anything.                                                                                                                          |
| `job:ready`                     | Fires when a job is ready to move into the execution stage, but before it does anything.                                                                                           |
| `job:updated`                   | Fires when there is an update to a job while it is executing.                                                                                                                      |
| `job:completed` OR `job:failed` | `job:completed` fires when a job is completed successfully, `job:failed` fires if a job is completed but fails. One of these events will fire upon job completion, but never both. |
| `job:outcome-acknowledged`      | Fires when a user acknowledges the completion of a job through a UI popup.                                                                                                         |

You can listen on any of these events in your [Listener](/concepts/listeners).

## Working With Jobs

### Management

Jobs can be managed via SDK/API. Commonly, Jobs are acknowledged, progressed, and then completed, or failed.

```jsx javascript
try {
  await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
    info: "Starting submit job...",
    progress: 10,
  });

  // Custom code here

  await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      message: "Submit job was completed succesfully.",
    },
  });
} catch (error) {
  await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
    outcome: {
      message: "This job failed.",
    },
  });
}
```

<Note>
  You can also use the [JobHandler
  Plugin](https://flatfile.com/docs/plugins/core/job-handler) which simplifies
  the handling of Flatfile Jobs. This plugin works by listening to the
  `job:ready` event and executing the handler callback. There is an optional
  tick function which updates the Job's progress.
</Note>

### Outcomes

A Job Outcome is the result of a process or operation that has been performed.
These outcomes are typically composed of a message that provides more context about the job's status.

For example, an outcome could be:

```
outcome: {
    message: "Data was successfully submitted.",
}
```

Or, in the case of a failed operation an outcome message can be tailored to provide futher details.

```
outcome: {
    message: `This job failed with a network error: ${error.message}`,
}
```
