In Flatfile, a Job represents a large unit of work performed asynchronously on a resource
such as a file, <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](../concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip>,
or <Tooltip tip="A collection of fields...">[Sheet](../blueprint/overview#terms)</Tooltip>.
The Jobs workflow provides visibility into the status and progress of your Jobs,
allowing you to monitor and troubleshoot the data processing pipeline.

#### Types of Jobs

There are 6 types of Flatfile managed Jobs:

1. Extracting data from a file (moving data from a file to a workbook)
2. Mapping data from one workbook to another (moving data from a workbook to a Workbook)
3. Deleting data from a Workbook (operating on data in a single Workbook)
4. Exporting data from a Workbook
5. Find and Replacing data in a Sheet
6. Apply a Mutate function to data in a Sheet

All of these operate on (potentially) large amounts of data and complete asynchronously;
you donâ€™t want to wait around for them, so we notify you when they're done.

## The Anatomy of a Job

Flatfile Jobs follow a standard structure:

- `type` - Workbook, File, Sheet, Space
- `operation` - `export`, `extract`, `map`, `delete`, and others
- `source` - id for the data source
- `destination?` - id for the data target (if any)
- `config` - a configuration object specific to the operation
- `trigger` - manual or immediate

In addition, Jobs track their execution state with:

- `status` - CREATED, PLANNING, SCHEDULED, READY, EXECUTING, COMPLETED, FAILED,
- `parts` - how many parts the Job was broken into
- `processed` - how many of those parts have been processed so far

## Using Jobs

An action in the UI can trigger a Job by POST-ing to the `/jobs` API endpoint.
If the `trigger` is `immediate` the Job will run immediately;
otherwise it can be triggered with a POST to the `/jobs/:id/execute` endpoint.

## Job Lifecycle Events

Jobs emit the following Events throughout their lifecycle that you can listen for:

- `job:completed` - emitted when a Job has completed successfully
- `job:created` - ??
- `job:deleted` - emitted when a Job has been deleted
- `job:failed` - emitted when a Job has failed
- `job:outcome-acknowleged` - ??
- `job:ready` - ??
- `job:scheduled` - ??
- `job:started` - emitted right before a Job starts execution
- `job:updated` - emitted when a Job's progress is updated
- `job:waiting` - emitted after a Job is created but before it begins executing

## Building with Jobs

How you build your UI is up to you, but here is one possibility:

1. Create a component that is used to trigger a Job
2. When the Job is triggered, POST to the `/jobs` endpoint
3. When the Job is complete, the server will send a `job:completed` Event
4. When the `job:completed` Event is received, update the UI to reflect the new state
