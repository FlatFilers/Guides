In Flatfile a Job represents a large unit of work performed asynchronously on a resource,
such as a file, workbook, or sheet. The Jobs workflow provides visibility into the status
and progress of your Jobs, allowing you to monitor and troubleshoot
the data processing pipeline.

For example, a job could represent a data export, or a remapping of data from
one sheet to another.

An action is the UI component that triggers a job, for example, a button or a text input.

Currently there are 4 types of jobs:

- Extracting data from a file (moving data from a file to a workbook)
- Mapping data from one workbook to another (moving data from a workbook to a workbook)
- Deleting data from a workbook (operating on data in a single workbook)
- Exporting data from a workbook

All of these operate on (potentially) large amounts of data and complete asynchronously;
you donâ€™t want to wait around for them, so we notify you when they're done.

#### The Anatomy of a Job

Flatfile jobs follow a standard structure:

- `type` - workbook, file, sheet
- `operation` - export, extract, map, delete
- `source` - id for the data source
- `destination?` - id for the data target (if any)
- `config` - a configuration object specific to the operation
- `trigger` - manual or immediate

In addition, jobs track their execution state with:

- `status` - PLANNING, READY, EXECUTING, COMPLETED, FAILED
- `parts` - how many parts the job was broken into
- `processed` - how many of those parts have been processed so far

#### Using Jobs

An action in the UI can trigger a job by POST-ing to the /jobs API endpoint.
If the `trigger` is `immediate` the job will run immediately;
otherwise it can be triggered with a POST to the /jobs/:id/execute endpoint.

#### Job Lifecycle Events

Jobs emit the following events throughout their lifecycle that you can listen for:

- `job:waiting` - emitted after a job is created but before it begins executing
- `job:started` - emitted right before a job starts execution
- `job:updated` - emitted when a job's progress is updated
- `job:failed` - emitted when a job has failed
- `job:completed` - emitted when a job has completed successfully
- `job:deleted` - emitted when a job has been deleted

#### Building with Jobs

How you build your UI is up to you, but here is one possibility:

- Create a component that can be used to trigger a job
- When the job is triggered, POST to the /jobs endpoint
- When the job is complete, the server will send a `job:completed` event
- When the `job:completed` event is received, update the UI to reflect the new state
