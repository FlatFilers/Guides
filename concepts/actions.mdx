An Action is a code-based operation that runs where that Action is mounted. Actions run when a user clicks the corresponding user prompt in Flatfile. Additional Actions can be mounted on a Sheet, a Workbook, or a file by a developer.

## Types of Actions

### Built-in Actions

Workbooks, Sheets and files come with five default built-in actions:

1. Mapping data from one workbook to another (moving data from a workbook to a Workbook)
2. Deleting data from a Workbook (or the entire file)
3. Exporting (downloading) data from a Workbook (or a file)
4. Find and Replacing data in a Sheet
5. Applying a Mutate function to data in a Sheet

When these built-in actions are clicked, they create Jobs. You can listen for these events and take appropriate actions if required. Learn more about [Jobs](../concepts/jobs).

### Developer-Created Actions

Additional Actions can be mounted on a Sheet, a Workbook, or a file. When an action is clicked, it will create a job `operation` on the `domain` it is mounted.

For example, an Action with the property `operation: 'my-action'` placed on a Workbook would spawn a job called: `workbook:my-action`. This is the job you'd listen for to respond accordingly.

## The Anatomy of an Action

### Required Parameters

All Actions contain the the information needed to let a user run the Action. This includes:

<ParamField path="operation" type="string" required>
  A unique identifier for the Action that is used by the listener to determine
  what work to do as part of the resulting Job.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="label" type="string" required>
  The text that will be displayed to the user in the UI as a button or menu
  item.
</ParamField>

### Optional Parameters

Optionally, an Action can also contain extra details about how it appears in the
UI. These include:

<ParamField path="primary" type="boolean" default="false">
  Whether the Action is a primary Action for the resource. Depending on the
  resource, primary Actions are displayed in the UI in a more prominent way.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="confirm" type="boolean" default="true">
  When set to true, a modal is shown to confirm the Action.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="description" type="string">
  The text that will be displayed to the user when a confirmation modal is used.
  Phrase this as a question.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="requireSelection" type="boolean" default="false">
  Setting this to true will disable a Sheet Action when no records in the Sheet
  are selected.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="requireAllValid" type="boolean" default="false">
  Setting this to true will disable a Sheet Action when there are invalid
  records.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="mode" type="string" default="background">
  Can be `foreground` or `background`. Foreground mode will prevent interacting
  with the resource until complete.
</ParamField>

## Usage

An Action with all of the above properties would look like this:

```js
{
  operation: 'my-action',
  label: 'My Action',
  primary: true,
  confirm: true,
  description: 'Are you sure you want to run this action?',
  requireSelection: true,
  requireAllValid: true,
  mode: 'foreground'
}
```
