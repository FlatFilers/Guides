The Flatfile platform includes a <Tooltip tip="View API reference">[REST API](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10)</Tooltip> for manipulating resources 
and an event bus for subscribing to notifications about those resources. 

The Flatfile PubSub Client is a super thin wrapper around the Flatfile API. 
It allows you to call our API after receiving events from any PubSub driver. 

#### The anatomy of an Event

Flatfile events follow a standard structure, and event listeners can use any of the following syntaxes to handle events within Flatfile.

[See API Reference](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10/c67125494272c-create-an-event)


### Using Events

Once an event is received, it is routed to any awaiting listeners which are added with `addEventListener()` or its alias `on()`.

An event context is passed to an **EventFilter**

```typescript
export type EventFilter = Record<string, Arrayable<string>>

// example event context
{ context: { sheetSlug: 'TestSheet' } }
```

#### Building with events

Using our powerful <Tooltip tip="View library">[@flatfile/listener](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/listener)</Tooltip> library we can intervene between any event and run a callback function based on values provided inside that event.

```typescript
client.on(
    'records:*', //listens for records:created & records:updated
    { target: 'sheet(TestSheet)' },
    (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
      //do something here
    }
  );
```
