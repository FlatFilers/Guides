The Flatfile platform includes a REST API for manipulating resources 
and an event bus for subscribing to notifications about those resources. 

The Flatfile **PubSub Client** is a super thin wrapper around the Flatfile API. 
It allows you to call our API after receiving events from any PubSub driver. 

#### The anatomy of an Event

Flatfile events follow a standard structure and event listeners can use any of the following syntaxes to react to events within Flatfile.

- `context` - something
- `target` - something


### Using Events

Once an event is received, it is routed to any awaiting listeners which are added with `addEventListener()` or its alias `on()`.

An event context is passed to an **EventFilter**

```typescript
export type EventFilter = Record<string, Arrayable<string>>

// example event context

{ context: { sheetSlug: 'TestSheet' } }

```

#### Usage

Using our powerful [@flatfile/listener](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/listener) library we can intervene between any event and run a callback function based on values provided inside that event.



```typescript

client.on(
    'records:*', //listens for records:created & records:updated
    { target: 'sheet(TestSheet)' },
    (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
      //do something here
    }
  );

```

The following is a list of events you can subscribe to:

```typescript

declare const EventTopic: {
   readonly Spaceadded: "space:added";
   readonly Spaceremoved: "space:removed";
   readonly Workbookadded: "workbook:added";
   readonly Workbookremoved: "workbook:removed";
   readonly Useradded: "user:added";
   readonly Userremoved: "user:removed";
   readonly Useronline: "user:online";
   readonly Useroffline: "user:offline";
   readonly Uploadstarted: "upload:started";
   readonly Uploadfailed: "upload:failed";
   readonly Uploadcompleted: "upload:completed";
   readonly Jobstarted: "job:started";
   readonly Jobwaiting: "job:waiting";
   readonly Jobupdated: "job:updated";
   readonly Jobfailed: "job:failed";
   readonly Jobcompleted: "job:completed";
   readonly Jobdeleted: "job:deleted";
   readonly Recordscreated: "records:created";
   readonly Recordsupdated: "records:updated";
   readonly Recordsdeleted: "records:deleted";
   readonly Sheetvalidated: "sheet:validated";
   readonly Filedeleted: "file:deleted";
   readonly Actiontriggered: "action:triggered";
   readonly Clientinit: "client:init";
}

```
