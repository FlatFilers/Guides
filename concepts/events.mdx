The Flatfile platform includes a <Tooltip tip="View API reference">[REST API](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api)</Tooltip> for manipulating resources 
and an event bus for subscribing to notifications about those resources. 

The Flatfile PubSub Client is a super thin wrapper around the Flatfile API. 
It allows you to call our API after receiving events from any PubSub driver. 

#### The anatomy of an Event

Flatfile events follow a standard structure, and event listeners can use any of the following syntaxes to handle events within Flatfile.

[See API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/c67125494272c-create-an-event)


### Using Events

Once an event is received, it is routed to any awaiting listeners which are added with `addEventListener()` or its alias `on()`.

An event context is passed to an **EventFilter**

```typescript
export type EventFilter = Record<string, Arrayable<string>>

// example event context
{ context: { sheetSlug: 'TestSheet' } }
```

#### Building with events

Using our powerful [@flatfile/listener](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/listener) library we can intervene between any event and run a callback function based on values provided inside that event.

```typescript
client.on(
    'records:*', //listens for records:created & records:updated
    { target: 'sheet(TestSheet)' },
    (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
      //do something here
    }
  );
```

## Event Topics

#### Workbook

<ParamField path="workbook:created" type="readonly">
  Called when a new workbook is created.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="workbook:updated" type="readonly">
  Called when workbook metadata is updated. For example, updating the name of a workbook. Adding data to a workbook does not emit this event.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="workbook:deleted" type="readonly">
  Called when a workbook is deleted.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sheet:created" type="readonly">
  Called when a new sheet is created within a workbook.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sheet:updated" type="readonly">
  Called when a sheet is updated. For example, running sheet level validations. Adding data to a sheet does not emit this event.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sheet:deleted" type="readonly">
  Called when a sheet is deleted.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="commit:created" type="readonly">
  Called when a new commit is created. For example, by creating or updating a cell.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="commit:updated" type="readonly">
  Called when commit metadata is updated. For example, approving or merging a commit. Commits cannot be deleted.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="layer:created" type="readonly">
  Called when a new layer is created within a commit. A layer is a programatically generated artifact of a commit. For example, when a data hook or formatting rule applies formatting or validation automatically. Layers cannot be updated or deleted, but you can ignore them to see the original source data.
</ParamField>

#### File Upload

<ParamField path="file:created" type="readonly">
  Called when a file upload begins or a new file is created.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="file:updated" type="readonly">
  Called when a file is updated. For example, when a file has been extracted into a workbook.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="file:deleted" type="readonly">
  Called when a file is deleted.
</ParamField>

#### Jobs

<ParamField path="job:created" type="readonly">
  Called when a new job is first created. Some jobs will enter an optional planning state at this time. A job with 'immediate' set to true will skip the planning step and transition directly to 'ready.'
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="job:ready" type="readonly">
  Called when a new job is ready to execute. Either the job has a complete plan of work or the job is configured to not need a plan. This is the only event most job implementations will care about. Once a ready job is acknowledged by a listener, it transations into an executing state.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="job:updated" type="readonly">
  Called when a job is updated. For example, when a listener updates the state or progress of the job. The event will emit many times as the listener incrementally copmletes work and updates the job.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="job:completed" type="readonly">
  Called when a job has completed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="job:outcome-acknowledged" type="readonly">
  Called to trigger workflow actions after the user has acknowledged that the job has completed or failed. Background jobs will skip this step.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="job:failed" type="readonly">
  Called when a job fails.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="job:scheduled" type="readonly">
  Called when a job has failed and needs to rerun. _This event is not currently implemented._
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="job:deleted" type="readonly">
  Called when a job is deleted.
</ParamField>

#### Agents

<ParamField path="agent:created" type="readonly">
  Called when a new agent is deployed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="agent:updated" type="readonly">
  Called when an agent is updated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="agent:deleted" type="readonly">
  Called when an agent is deleted.
</ParamField>

#### Space

<ParamField path="space:created" type="readonly">
  Called when a new space is created.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="space:deleted" type="readonly">
  Called when a space is deleted.
</ParamField>
