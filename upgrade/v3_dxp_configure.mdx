<Warning>
    This package simply extends functionality within our [@flatfile/configure package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/configure). If you're not already using that package, this is an unnecessary step and you should [start here](/upgrade/v3_upgrade) instead.
</Warning>

## Before you begin
Before you get started, there are both some new and redesigned terms to learn. Check out our Portal 3 Upgrade Guide's [before you begin section](/upgrade/v3_upgrade#before-you-begin) to learn about these concepts.

## Using the plugin
If you're using the [Portal 3 class-based syntax](https://flatfile.com/versioned-docs/3.0/guides/workbooks/) for creating your Workbooks, Sheets, etc., the `dxpConfigure` method lets you pass in those classes and create your new Platform setup without having to move away from the classes for now.

In the below example, there is a Workbook that is being created with the class-based syntax like `new Workbook()`, `new Sheet()` and `TextField()`. The new Platform has moved away from this syntax to an object-based approach. While you won't need to convert to this syntax, it is good to [learn about it here](/upgrade/v3_upgrade#fields-data-types-and-the-new-way-to-create-them) for any future use cases you might have.

```js my-dxp-workbook.js
import { Sheet, TextField, Workbook } from "@flatfile/configure";

export const MyWorkbook = new Workbook({
  name: "My Workbook",
  namespace: "test",
  sheets: {
    mySheet: new Sheet("Test", {
      name: TextField("Full Name"),
      email: TextField({
        label: "Email Address",
        compute: (val) => {
          return val.toLowerCase();
        },
      }),
    }),
  },
});
```

With the `dxpConfigure` method, we can now plug this into a [Listener](/quickstart/meet-the-listener) to create a new Workbook from the v3 class-based syntax.

```js listener.js
import { MyWorkbook } from './my-dxp-workbook.js'
import { dxpConfigure } from '@flatfile/plugin-dxp-configure'

export default (listener) => {
  listener.use(dxpConfigure(MyWorkbook))
}
```
