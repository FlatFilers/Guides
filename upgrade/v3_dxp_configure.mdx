<Warning>
    While we have no official date for its deprecation, this way of converting to the Platform will not keep long-term support. For this reason, we recommend only utilizing this guide if you are already using the [@flatfile/configure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/configure) package. If you aren't, ignore this guide and [start here](/upgrade/v3_upgrade) instead.
</Warning>

## Before starting
Before you get started, there is both some new and redesigned terminology you should learn. Check out our Portal 3 Upgrade Guide's [before you begin section](/upgrade/v3_upgrade#before-you-begin) to learn about these concepts.

## Using the plugin
If you are using the Portal 3 class-based syntax for creating your Workbooks, Sheets, etc, the `dxpConfigure` method can help you pass in those classes and create your new Platform setup without having to move away from the classes just yet.

In the below example, you'll see we have a Workbook that is being created with the `new Workbook()`, `new Sheet()` and `TextField()` syntax.

```js my-dxp-workbook.js
import { Sheet, TextField, Workbook } from "@flatfile/configure";

export const MyWorkbook = new Workbook({
  name: "My Workbook",
  namespace: "test",
  sheets: {
    mySheet: new Sheet("Test", {
      name: TextField("Full Name"),
      email: TextField({
        label: "Email Address",
        compute: (val) => {
          return val.toLowerCase();
        },
      }),
    }),
  },
});
```

With the `dxpConfigure` method, we can now plug this into a [Listener](/quickstart/meet-the-listener) to create a new Workbook from the v3 class-based syntax.

```js listener.js
import { MyWorkbook } from './my-dxp-workbook.js'
import { dxpConfigure } from '@flatfile/plugin-dxp-configure'

export default (listener) => {
  listener.use(dxpConfigure(MyWorkbook))
}
```
