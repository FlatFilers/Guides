## Before you begin

### Signup for the new Platform

While both this and our version before it live in your current dashboard
together, our new Platform has its own space. Before you can get started, you'll
need to signup for a new account [here](https://flatfile.com/account/sign-up/).

### Environments

When talking about Environments in Portal 3.0, you had two to work with, dev and
prod. While the same concept of Environments exists in Platform, you will now be
able to create as many Environments as you need. By default, you will have a
Development, Production, and Demo Environment configured upon signup. You can
use these Environments and create more as needed. You can create additional
Environments
[using our APIs](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/environments/create-an-environment)
or by using the "New Environment" button on the environment switcher in the
Dashboard.

### Portal vs Space

In the current Flatfile versions (V2 and V3), we refer to Portal as an iFrame
that opens on a button click to allow your customers to import data. In Platform
(the new version), we still call the process of embedding a Portal, but we refer
to what is embedded as a Space. A Space is an open-ended component by design.
You can have a Space per customer, a Space per project, or something else that
fits your workflow. It is up to you. You can either work in a Space inside your
Flatfile dashboard or you can embed a Space into your application that opens
when your customers click on the Import button. A good way to think of a Space
is as a collection of Workbooks (explained below), while a Workbook is a
collection of Sheets. You can learn more about the structure and functionality
of Spaces [in this guide](/learning-center/architecture/spaces).

## Familiar concepts present in the new and current versions

### The new Workbook

In Platform (the new version), a Workbook is a collection of Sheets that
describe the expected shape of the data you receive. You can learn more about
the structure and functionality of Workbooks [in this guide](/learning-center/architecture/workbooks).
To create a Workbook, you can refer to our
[Getting Started guide](/learning-center/tutorials/10min/meet-the-workbook).

### Same Sheet, different product

The Sheet, how it interacts with the Workbook, and what it's for are all the
same. We are calling the collections of Sheets that is the shape of your data
Blueprints. You can learn about all the options of
[Blueprints here](/documentation/blueprint/about), but there is not a whole lot that needs
to be said for you to understand it and get rolling.

### Fields, data types and the new way to create them

If you're coming from Portal 3.0 and using the PSDK, you will be familiar with
something that looks like `new Sheet('name', { fieldName: TextField() })`. This
syntax has changed to go back to an Object-based approach that looks more
similar to the shape of the underlying API that powers it. Let's go through the
different field types and their new syntax, shown as part of a workbook in the
Platform.

#### Compare fields

<CodeGroup>

    ```js Portal 3.0
    const MySheet = new Sheet('MySheet', {
        name: TextField({
            label: 'Name',
            description: 'A name field',
            required: true
        }),
        subscriber: BooleanField({label: "Subscribed?"}),
        status: OptionField({
            label: 'Deal Status',
            options: {
                new: { label: 'New' },
                interested: { label: 'Interested' },
                meeting: { label: 'Meeting' },
                opportunity: { label: 'Opportunity' },
                unqualified: { label: 'Not a fit' },
            },
        })
    }
    ```

    ```js Platform
    const Workbook = {
        name: "Contacts",
        sheets: [
            {
                name: "MySheet",
                slug: "my_sheet",
                fields: [
                    {
                        key: "name",
                        type: "string",
                        description: "A name field",
                        label: "Name",
                        constraints: [{ type: "required" }]
                    },
                    {
                        key: "subscriber",
                        type: "boolean",
                        label: "Subscribed?"
                    },
                    {
                        key: "status",
                        type: "enum",
                        label: "Deal Status",
                        constraints: [{ type: "required" }],
                        config: {
                            options: [
                                { label: "New", value: "new" },
                                { label: "Interested", value: "interested" },
                                { label: "Meeting", value: "meeting" },
                                { label: "Opportunity", value: "opportunity" },
                                { label: "Not a fit", value: "unqualified" }
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

## Things that moved

Believe it or not, the way you write DataHooks has mostly stayed the same, but
where you write your DataHooks is different. The Platform has what we call
[Listeners](/learning-center/tutorials/10min/meet-the-listener). Listeners, as you might expect,
wait for specific Events in the Platform to happen and then execute any of the
code in the Listeners subscribed to that event. In order for your Data Hook code
to run as expected, you also need to use the proper Plugin for it to work. We
have created a number of open-source plugins for the Platform, with our
[@plugin-record-hook](https://flatfile.com/plugins/plugin-record-hook) being one
of them. Let's take a look at an example of a simple record hook now compared to
in Portal 3.0.

<CodeGroup>

    ```js Portal 3.0
    const MySheet = new Sheet('MySheet', {
        name: TextField({
            label: 'Name',
            description: 'A name field',
            required: true
        })
    },
    {
        recordCompute: (record) => {
            const { name } = record.value
            if (name === 'David') {
                record.addWarning('name', 'This is the CEO!!')
            }
            return record
        }
    })
    ```

    ```js Platform
    listener.use(
        recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
            const name = record.get('name')
            if (name === 'David') {
                record.addWarning('name', 'This is the CEO!!')
            }
            return record
        })
    )
    ```

## Using GraphQL?

Were you using our GraphQL API in v3? Did you love it? No???? Same here. As
developers we might still love GraphQL, but offering it as the best and most
polished form of our API felt wrong. For Platform, our main and best kept form
of API is our REST API. You can find references to the new API
[in our documentation](https://reference.flatfile.com/).
