File feeds are one of the most common ways to exchange batches of data on a regular basis.
One key challenge for a traditional feed, however, is its inflexibility.
If anything changes about the way source data is extracted, or the destination schema is configured, the feed is all but guaranteed to break.

With Flatfile's powerful headless data import capabilities, you can seamlessly integrate a headless but _adaptable_ data connection into your system.

## How it works

You can achieve a fully automated data exchange between systems in just three steps:

[Automate ingress](#automate-ingress) \
Implement a flexible data pipeline that seamlessly uploads files to Flatfile without manual intervention, streamlining the process of data intake.

[Flatfile processing](#flatfile-processing) \
Within the Flatfile Platform, build a comprehensive configuration that enables automated extraction, mapping, validation, and transformation of your data.

[Automate egress](#automate-egress) \
Finally, leverage Flatfile's [Event](../concepts/events) driven system to automatically export the processed and transformed data from Flatfile to the designated destination system, eliminating the need for manual exporting and ensuring a continuous flow of data to the intended location.

## Automate ingress

Data comes from many sources, and Flatfile can handle them all. Set up automatic feeds via cron job, cloud function, or any other method that works for your business.

All ingress processes will leverage either our [API](../api/overview) or our SDKs.

First, configure an ingress destination. Our files will be contained in a Space. You can think of a <Tooltip tip="A micro-application...">[Space](../concepts/spaces)</Tooltip> as a micro-application, each has it's own database and configurations.

<Snippet file="use-cases/block1.mdx" />
<br></br>
<Note>
  Our deployed agent will automatically configure a Space. For more
  information on how to configure a Space, see our [Dynamic
  Configurations](...guides/dynamic-configurations#configuring-a-new-space).
</Note>

Next, we'll upload our file to Flatfile.

<Snippet file="use-cases/block2.mdx" />

## Flatfile Processing

### Extract incoming data

Incoming CSV files are automatically extracted to a <Tooltip tip="A collection of data...">[Workbook](../concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip>.

However, if you're sending a different file type, you'll need to configure a listener to handle extraction. Listen for a `file:created` event and run your subsequent extraction logic as an asynchronous [Job](../concepts/jobs).

<Note>
  See our [Extractor Plugins](../plugins/extractors) for plug and play options
  or build your own.
</Note>

### Automate mapping

Once our files are being automatically uploaded and extracted, we'll need to automate the mapping of our data to our destination schema. Our Automap Plugin will automatically map the data, matching based on configureable options. See our [Automap Guide](../guides/automap) for more information.

### Validate & Transform

Similarly, validation and transformation operations can run immediately on `records:created` and `records:updated` events. See our [Data Handling Guide](../guides/handling-data) for more information.

### Automate egress

Now that we've leveraged the power of the Flatfile platform to extract, map, validate, and transform our data, we can automate the egress of our data to our destination system.

We'll listen on the `sheet:submitAction` event, set in our Dynamically Configured Space, and run our egress logic as an asynchronous [Job](../concepts/jobs). Here's an example where we automate emailing the processed data.

<Snippet file="use-cases/block3.mdx" />

<Note>
  Egress Jobs may need to leverage Flatfile Secrets as credentials for outgoing
  connections. See our [Secrets Guide](../guides/secrets) for more information.
