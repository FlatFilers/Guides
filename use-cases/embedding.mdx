Embed React is a front-end SDK wrapper around the [Flatfile API](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/). It allows you to securely and easily add an embedded data import experience, also known as a [Space](/concepts/spaces), to any React app.

Using an iframe, Embed React seamlessly integrates into your website or application, providing a simple yet robust experience for collecting and transforming data from your customers.

<Info>
  Prerequisites: You'll need a Flatfile account and your [publishable
  key](../developer-tools/security/authentication#secret-and-publishable-keys)
  to complete this tutorial. [Sign
  up](https://platform.flatfile.com/account/sign-up) and use the publishable key
  from your `development` environment for this tutorial.
</Info>

### Check React version

The minimum supported version is **React v16**.

Depending on your package manager, you can check your version in the terminal as follows.
If you use an older version, you'll need to upgrade before beginning with Flatfile Embedded React.

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
npm view react version

# expect "16.0.0" or greater
```

```yarn yarn
yarn info react version

# expect the react version to be "16.0.0" or greater
```

</CodeGroup>

### Install the package

Install Embed React from the npm/yarn public registry.

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
npm install @flatfile/react@latest
```

```yarn yarn
yarn add @flatfile/react@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

### Gather configuration details

<Info>
  API keys are created automatically. Use the [Developers
  Page](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) to reveal your publishable key
  for each Environment. Learn more about
  [Authentication](../developer-tools/security/authentication).
</Info>

The publishable key is safe to be used in client-side applications as it has limited access to the Flatfile API.
Copy your `publishable key` and `environment id` from the dashboard to a notepad.
You'll need these in the next step.
