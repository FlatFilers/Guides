Embed React is a front-end SDK wrapper around the [Flatfile API](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/). It allows you to securely and easily add an embedded data import experience, also known as a [Space](/concepts/spaces), to any React app.

Using an iframe, Embed React seamlessly integrates into your website or application, providing a simple yet robust experience for collecting and transforming data from your customers.
