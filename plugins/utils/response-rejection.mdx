    The `@flatfile/util-response-rejection` utility is built to handle response rejections
    from an external source. It is designed to be used as a rejection response handler
    in an egress listener.

## Code Breakdown

The purpose of this plugin is to handle cases where some Records were rejected during an egress process. The `responseRejectionHandler` function is designed to consume a set of sheets with rejected records, and then process those records (mark them with an error message indicating why they were rejected). In the end, it returns a total count of all rejected records across all sheets.

### **Response Rejection Handler Function**

- The `responseRejectionHandler` function is the main entry point of the utility. It takes one parameter:
  - `partialRejection`: An object containing the rejection data. This object's structure is defined by the `ResponseRejection` interface.
- The `responseRejectionHandler` function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a number representing the total number of rejected records across all sheets.

### **ResponseRejection Interface**

The `ResponseRejection` interface defines the structure of the `partialRejection` parameter object that is passed into the `responseRejectionHandler` function. This `ResponseRejection`'s structure is as follows:

```ts
{ // ResponseRejection interface
  id: string; // The Workbook ID
  sheets: [
    { // ResponseRejectionSheet interface
      id: string; // The Sheet ID
      rejectedRecords: [
        { // ResponseRejectionRecord interface
          id: string; // The Record ID
          values: [
            {
              field: string; // The field name
              message: string;
            }
          ];
        }
        // ...
      ];
    }
    // ...
  ];
}
```

### **Helper Functions**

- The code includes a helper functions to assist in the Flatfile Sheet update process:
  - `updateSheet`: Updates a Flatfile Sheet by adding the returned rejection messages as error messages on the Records.

### **Type Definitions**

- The code defines three interfaces: `ResponseRejection`, `ResponseRejectionSheet` and `ResponseRejectionRecord`. These interfaces represent the structure expected by the `responseRejectionHandler()`.
