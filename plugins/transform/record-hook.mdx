### Overview

This plugin exports a function named `recordHook` that sets up an Event listener for the `commit:created` Event. 
The purpose of this plugin is to provide a concise syntax for running custom logic on individual data records in Flatfile.


```SSH install
npm i @flatfile/plugin-record-hook @flatfile/hooks
```

---

## Import

```js
import { FlatfileRecord, recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-record-hook'
import { FlatfileEvent, FlatfileListener } from "@flatfile/listener";
```

## Usage

Pass `recordHook` to a Flatfile data listener and provide a function to run when data is added or updated.

### 1. Create a listener

Set up a listener to configure Flatfile and respond to data Events:

<CodeGroup>

```js javascript
export default function (listener) {
  // Simple listener
  listener.on("**", (event) => {
    console.log(`-> My event listener received an event: ${event.topic}`);
  });
}
```

```js typescript
export default function (listener: FlatfileListener) {
  // Simple listener
  listener.on("**", (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
    console.log(`-> My event listener received an event: ${event.topic}`);
  });
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Listen for data changes

Use the this plugin to set up a hook that responds to data changes:

<CodeGroup>

```js javascript
import { FlatfileRecord, recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-record-hook'

listener.use(
  recordHook('my-sheet', (record, event) => {
    // Your logic goes here
  })
);
```

```js typescript
import { FlatfileRecord, recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-record-hook'

listener.use(
  recordHook('my-sheet', (record: FlatfileRecord, event: FlatfileEvent) => {
    // Your logic goes here
  })
);
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `my-sheet` with the slug of the Sheet you want to attach this hook to.

## Example usage

This example sets up a record hook using listener.use to modify records 
in the "my-sheet" sheet. 

When a record is processed by the hook, it checks if the "firstName" and "lastName" fields exist and if the "fullName" field is not already populated. 
If these conditions are met, it sets the "fullName" field by concatenating the "firstName" and "lastName" values with a space in between. 

Additionally, it adds a comment to the "fullName" 
field in the user interface indicating that it was populated from the first and last name.

<CodeGroup>
```js javascript
listener.use(
  recordHook('my-sheet', (record, event) => {
    const firstName = record.get('firstName');
    const lastName = record.get('lastName');

    if (firstName && lastName && !record.get('fullName')) {
      const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
      record.set('fullName', fullName);

      record.addComment('fullName', 'Full name was populated from first and last name.');
    }

    return record;
  })
);
```

```js typescript
listener.use(
  recordHook('my-sheet', (record: FlatfileRecord, event: FlatfileEvent) => {
    const firstName = record.get('firstName');
    const lastName = record.get('lastName');

    if (firstName && lastName && !record.get('fullName')) {
      const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
      record.set('fullName', fullName);

      record.addComment('fullName', 'Full name was populated from first and last name.');
    }

    return record;
  })
);
```
</CodeGroup>
