```SSH install
npm i @flatfile/plugin-export-workbook
```

```ts import
import { exportWorkbookPlugin } from "@flatfile/plugin-export-workbook";
```

```ts workbook.config.json
  // ... inside Workbook configuration
  "actions": [
    {
      "operation": "downloadExcelWorkbook",
      "mode": "foreground",
      "label": "Download Excel Workbook",
      "description": "Downloads Excel Workbook of Data",
      "primary": true
    }
  ]
  // ...
```
