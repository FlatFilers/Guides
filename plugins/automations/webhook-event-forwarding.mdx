    The `@flatfile/plugin-automation-webhook-event-forwarding"` plugin listens for
    flatfile events and forwards them to a given endpoint via webhook. This
    allows for language-agnostic processing of flatfile events and allows for
    receiving data back from the given endpoint for robust processing workflows.

<ParamField path="url" type="string">

  get the URL from your environment file. If not specified through either method
  it will fail.

```ts
import { forwardWebhook } from "@flatfile/plugin-automation-webhook-event-forwarding"

```ts listener.ts
  listener.use(forwardWebhook("https://webhook.site/yourwebhooksitehere", (data) => {
    //do stuff here
  }))
```
