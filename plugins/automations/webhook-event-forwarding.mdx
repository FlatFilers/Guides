  <Card title="@flatfile/plugin-webhook-event-forwarder" icon="download">
    The `@flatfile/plugin-webhook-event-forwarder"` plugin listens for Flatfile
    Events and forwards them to a given endpoint via webhook. This allows for
    language-agnostic processing of Flatfile Events and allows for receiving
    data back from the given endpoint for robust processing workflows.
  </Card>

## Parameters

<ParamField path="url" type="string">
  The URL to send the webhook requests to. If not specified it will attempt to
  get the URL from your environment file. If not specified through either method
  it will fail.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="callback" type="function">
  A callback to run after the request completes. If the callback returns data,

basic `webhook.site` endpoint.

```bash install
npm i @flatfile/plugin-webhook-event-forwarder
```

```ts
import { webhookEventForward } from "@flatfile/plugin-webhook-event-forwarder";
```

```ts listener.ts
listener.use(
  webhookEventForward("https://webhook.site/yourwebhooksitehere", (data) => {
    //do stuff here
  })
);
```
