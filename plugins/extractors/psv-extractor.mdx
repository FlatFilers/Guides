    The `@flatfile/plugin-psv-extractor` package is a plugin for parsing .psv files and extracting them into Flatfile. It utilizes various libraries to parse PSV files and retrieve the structured data efficiently.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    **Event Type:**<br/>`listener.on('file:created')`
    <br/>
    **Supported file types:**<br/>`.psv`

## Parameters

<ParamField path="dynamicTyping" type="boolean" default="false">
  If `true`, numeric and boolean data will be converted to their type instead of
  remaining strings. Numeric data must conform to the definition of a decimal
  literal. Numerical values greater than 2^53 or less than -2^53 will not be
  converted to numbers to preserve precision. European-formatted numbers must
  have commas and dots swapped.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="skipEmptyLines" type="boolean | 'greedy'">
  If `true`, lines that are completely empty (those which evaluate to an empty
  string) will be skipped. If set to `greedy`, lines that don't have any content
  (those which have only whitespace after parsing) will also be skipped.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="transform" type="function">
  A function to apply on each value. The function receives the value as an
  argument The return value of the function will replace the value it received.
  The transform function is applied before `dynamicTyping`.
</ParamField>

## Imported NPM Packages

- [`@flatfile/delimiter-extractor`](../plugins/extractors/delimiter-extractor) is a generic extractor for extracting and parsing delimited data from various file formats and sources.

## Usage

Listen for an PSV file to be uploaded to Flatfile. The platform will then extract the file automatically. Once complete, the file will be ready for import in the Files area.

```SSH install
npm i @flatfile/plugin-psv-extractor
```

```js import
import { PSVExtractor } from "@flatfile/plugin-psv-extractor";
```

```js listener.js
listener.use(PSVExtractor());
```

### Full Example

In this example, the PSVExtractor is initialized with optional options, and then registered as middleware with the Flatfile listener. When a PSV file is uploaded, the plugin will extract the structured data and process it using the extractor's parser.

```javascript
import { PSVExtractor } from "@flatfile/psv-extractor";

// Define optional options for the extractor (e.g., { dynamicTyping: true })
const options = {
  dynamicTyping: true,
  skipEmptyLines: true,
  transform: (value) => value.toUpperCase(),
};

// Initialize the PSV extractor
const psvExtractor = PSVExtractor(options);

// Register the extractor as a middleware for the Flatfile listener
listener.use(psvExtractor);

// When a PSV file is uploaded, the data will be extracted and processed using the extractor's parser.
```
