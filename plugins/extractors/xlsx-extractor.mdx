## Parameters

<ParamField path="rawNumbers" type="boolean">
  In Excel, you could have rounding or formatting on a number cell to only
  display say 2 decimal places. By default, Flatfile will just take the
  displayed decimal places versus the raw numbers. Set this value to true to
  take the raw numbers and disregard how itâ€™s displayed in Excel.
</ParamField>

## Imported NPM Packages

- `xlsx` allows for reading, writing, and manipulating Microsoft Excel files in JavaScript applications.
- `@flatfile/util-extractor` provides utility functions for extracting and parsing data from various file formats and sources, streamlining data import processes.
- `remeda` offers a set of utility functions for functional programming and data manipulation in JavaScript, providing a convenient way to work with arrays and objects.

## Usage

Listen for an Excel file (all extensions supported) to be uploaded to Flatfile. The platform will then extract the file automatically. Once complete, the file will be ready for import in the Files area.

```SSH install
npm i @flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor
```

```js import
import { ExcelExtractor } from "@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor";
```

<CodeGroup>

```js listener.js
listener.use(ExcelExtractor());
```

```js additional options
listener.use(ExcelExtractor({ rawNumbers: true }));
```

</CodeGroup>

### Full Example

In this example, the ExcelExtractor is initialized with optional options, and then registered as middleware with the Flatfile listener. When an Excel file is uploaded, the plugin will extract the structured data and process it using the provided callback function.

```javascript
import { ExcelExtractor } from "@flatfile/xlsx-extractor";

// Define optional options for the extractor (e.g., { rawNumbers: true })
const options = { rawNumbers: true };

// Initialize the Excel extractor
const excelExtractor = ExcelExtractor(options);

// Register the extractor as a middleware for the Flatfile listener
listener.use(excelExtractor);

// When an Excelfile is uploaded, the data will be extracted and processed using the provided callback function.
```
