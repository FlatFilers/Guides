### Overview

This plugin parses a JSON file and extracts first-level nested objects as Sheets in Flatfile.

See a working example in our [flatfile-docs-kitchen-sink](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-docs-kitchen-sink/blob/main/typescript/extractors/index.ts) Github repo.

```SSH Install
npm i @flatfile/plugin-json-extractor
```


---

## Import

```js
import { jsonExtractorPlugin } from '@flatfile/plugin-json-extractor'
```

## Usage

Listen for a JSON file to be uploaded to Flatfile. The platform will then extract the file automatically. Once complete, the file will be ready for import in the Files area.

```js
listener.use(jsonExtractorPlugin())
```
