## Imported NPM Packages

- [`@flatfile/util-file-buffer`](../utils/file-buffer) provides utility functions for processing files and extracting their contents using the Flatfile API.
- [`AdmZip`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adm-zip) provides utility functions for decompressing files and directories from ZIP format.
- [`remeda`](https://remedajs.com/) offers a set of utility functions for functional programming and data manipulation in JavaScript, providing a convenient way to work with arrays and objects.

## Usage

Listen for a ZIP file to be uploaded to Flatfile. The file will be downloaded, unzipped, and the contents uploaded back to Flatfile. Once complete, the file will be ready for import in the Files area. This plugin is designed to be used in conjuction with other extractors, such as the [Excel Extractor](../extractors/xlsx-extractor), to extract and process the contents of the files contained in the ZIP file. Files with names beginning with `.` will be ignored as these are typically system files (i.e. `.DS_store`).

```SSH install
npm i @flatfile/plugin-zip-extractor
```

```js import
import { ZipExtractor } from "@flatfile/plugin-zip-extractor";
```

```js listener.js
listener.use(ZipExtractor());
```

### Full Example

In this example, the `ZipExtractor` is initialized, and then registered as middleware with the Flatfile listener. When a JSON file is uploaded, the plugin will extract the contents of the ZIP file and upload the files to FlatFile.

```javascript
import { ZipExtractor } from "@flatfile/plugin-zip-extractor";

// Initialize the ZIP extractor
const zipExtractor = ZipExtractor();

// Register the extractor as a middleware for the Flatfile listener
listener.use(zipExtractor);

// When a ZIP file is uploaded, the files will be extracted and uploaded.
```
