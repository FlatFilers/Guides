The `delete` command allows you to remove a deployed agent from your Flatfile environment. This is useful when you no longer need an agent or want to clean up your environment.

## Usage

To delete an agent, use the following command:

npx flatfile delete

### Options

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--slug` or `-s` | The slug of the agent to delete  |
| `--agentId` or `-ag` | The ID of the agent to delete |


## Confirmation

By default, the delete command will ask for confirmation before removing an agent:

You must type `y` or `yes` to proceed with the deletion. Any other input will cancel the operation.

## Using environment variables

You can also store your Flatfile secret key in a `.env` file:



Then run the command without the token parameter:
