The Flatfile Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a set of tools to help you develop, deploy, and manage [Listeners](/learning-center/concepts/listeners) and Agents in your Flatfile environment.

## Installation

The Flatfile CLI is available as an npm package and can be installed globally or used with npx:



## Authentication

Most CLI commands require authentication with your Flatfile API key. You can provide this in two ways:

1. Using the `--token` or `-t` option with each command:
   

2. Creating a `.env` file in your project directory:
   

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [develop](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/develop) | Run your project as a local listener for development |
| [deploy](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/deploy) | Deploy your project as a Flatfile Agent |
| [list](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management) | List all deployed Agents in your environment |
| [download](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management) | Download an agent from your environment |
| [delete](/documentation/core-libraries/cli/agent-management) | Delete an Agent from your environment |

## Development Workflow

A typical development workflow with the Flatfile CLI looks like this:

1. **Develop locally**: Use `npx flatfile develop` to run your listener locally and test changes in real-time
2. **Deploy to Flatfile**: When ready, use `npx flatfile deploy` to deploy your listener as an Agent
3. **Manage Agents**: Use `npx flatfile list` to view deployed Agents and `npx flatfile delete` to remove them when needed
4. **Download Agents**: Use `npx flatfile download-agent` to retrieve the code of a deployed Agent for inspection or modification

## Environment Isolation

It's recommended to use an isolated environment for development to avoid conflicts with deployed Agents. The CLI will warn you if you're working in an environment that already has deployed Agents.
