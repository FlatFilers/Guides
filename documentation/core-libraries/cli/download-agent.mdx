The `download-agent` command allows you to download an existing agent from your Flatfile environment to your local machine. This is useful when you need to:

- Examine the code of a deployed agent
- Make modifications to an existing agent
- Back up your agent code
- Debug issues with a deployed agent

## Usage

To download an agent, use the following command:



### Options

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--token` or `-t` | Your Flatfile secret key (not required if stored in .env file) |
| `--agent` or `-a` | The ID or slug of the agent to download |
| `--output` or `-o` | The directory where the agent code will be saved (defaults to current directory) |

## Examples

### Download an agent using its ID



### Download an agent using its slug



### Using environment variables

You can also store your Flatfile secret key in a `.env` file:



Then run the command without the token parameter:



## Output

The command will create a JavaScript or TypeScript file containing the agent code in the specified output directory. If no output directory is specified, the file will be created in the current directory.

The filename will be based on the agent's slug or ID, for example:
- `my-custom-agent.js`
- `us_ag_123456.js`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues when downloading an agent:

1. Ensure you're using a valid secret key with appropriate permissions
2. Verify that the agent ID or slug is correct
3. Check that you have write permissions to the output directory
4. Make sure you're connected to the internet and can access the Flatfile API

If problems persist, you can contact Flatfile support for assistance.
