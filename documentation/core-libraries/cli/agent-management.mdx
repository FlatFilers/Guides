## Listing Agents

To view all agents in your environment, use the following command:

```bash
npx flatfile agents list
```

## Downloading Agents

To `download`command allows you to download a copy of the agent's source code to your local machine. This is useful when you need to:
- Examine the code of a deployed agent
- Make modifications to an existing agent
- Back up your agent code
- Debug issues with a deployed agent

To download an agent, use the following command:

```bash
npx flatfile agents download <slug>
```

<Tip>
  Use the `list` command to get the slug or id of the agent you want to manage.
</Tip>

## Delete An Agent

The `delete` command allows you to remove a deployed agent from your Flatfile environment. This is useful when you no longer need an agent or want to clean up your environment.


To delete an agent, use the following command:

`npx flatfile delete <slug>`
