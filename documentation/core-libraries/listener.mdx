The Flatfile Listener is a core building block of the Flatfile platform. 
Listening and responding to events is what enables developers to build powerful integrations with Flatfile.
This package enables you to handle all the events in your data pipeline — from the moment data arrives to its final transformation. Think of it as your event command center.

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { Listener } from "@flatfile/listener"

export default (listener: Listener) => {
  listener.on('**', (event) => {
    console.log(event)
  })
}
```

## Core Components
Let's explore the building blocks that make the Listener powerful.


### Working with Records

These classes give you full control over your data, letting you read, modify, and validate records with ease.

### Managing Sessions

Keep tabs on everything happening in your workspace — from active uploads to schema changes.

### Event Handling

Catch and respond to any action in your data pipeline. Whether it's new data arriving or a validation completing, you're in control.

### Authentication

Handle API calls securely with built-in authentication and header management.
