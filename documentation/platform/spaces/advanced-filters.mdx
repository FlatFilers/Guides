## Overview

Advanced Filters is a powerful feature in Flatfile that allows you to create complex, multi-field queries to filter your data. This feature enables you to build sophisticated filter combinations with multiple conditions across different fields, giving you precise control over which records are displayed.

## Key Concepts

Advanced Filters introduces several new concepts:

- **Query Collection**: A set of queries that are combined together to create a grouped FFQL string
  - **Atomic Collection**: A collection with exactly one query for a single field
  - **Advanced Collection**: A collection of multiple queries across many fields

- **Query**: A definition of search criteria that, when assembled, creates a qualified FFQL string
  - **queryField**: The key of the column being queried
  - **queryOperation**: The clause for the query (e.g., is, is not, empty, etc.)
  - **queryValues**: The specific value(s) being searched for
  - **joinPrefix**: The clause used for combining this query with its predecessor (i.e., "and", "or")

## Using Advanced Filters

### In the User Interface

1. **Access the Filter Menu**: Click the "Filter" button in the sheet toolbar
2. **Create a Simple Filter**: Select a field from the dropdown to create an atomic filter
3. **Create an Advanced Filter**: Click the "Advanced filter" option in the dropdown menu
4. **Build Your Query**:
   - Select fields to filter on
   - Choose operations (is, is not, contains, etc.)
   - Enter values to filter by
   - Use "AND" or "OR" operators to combine conditions

### Filter Operations

Advanced Filters supports the following operations:

- `is`: Exact match
- `is not`: Excludes exact matches
- `is empty`: Field has no value
- `not empty`: Field has any value
- `>`: Greater than (for numeric fields)
- `<`: Less than (for numeric fields)
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to (for numeric fields)
- `<=`: Less than or equal to (for numeric fields)

## Examples

### Simple Filter (Atomic Collection)

Filter records where the "firstName" field equals "John":

```
firstName is "John"
```

### Advanced Filter (Multiple Fields)

Filter records where the "firstName" is "John" AND the "age" is greater than 30:

```
firstName is "John" AND age > 30
```

### Complex Filter (Multiple Conditions)

Filter records where the "firstName" is "John" OR "Jane" AND the "status" is not "Inactive":

```
(firstName is "John" OR firstName is "Jane") AND status is not "Inactive"
```

## Enabling Advanced Filters

### Prepare Application

Advanced Filters is enabled by default in the Prepare application.

### Spaces-UI Application

To enable Advanced Filters in Spaces-UI:

1. Apply the `advancedFilters` feature flag via Brewster for your environment
2. The feature will then be available in your Spaces-UI application

## Technical Implementation

Advanced Filters leverages Flatfile Query Language (FFQL) behind the scenes, but provides a more user-friendly interface for building complex queries. The feature stores filter parameters in local storage for continued retrieval across sessions.

For more information on the underlying query language, see the [Flatfile Query Language (FFQL)](/learning-center/guides/flatfile_query_language) documentation.

## Best Practices

- Start with simple filters and gradually add complexity
- Use parentheses to group logical conditions for clarity
- Consider performance implications when filtering very large datasets with multiple conditions
- Save commonly used filters as Views for quick access (if Views feature is enabled)
