Permissions in Flatfile are determined by a combination of:
- The user's role (Administrator or Guest)
- The specific access grants assigned to guests (Space-level or Workbook-level)
- Sheet-level access controls configured in the Blueprint

## Administrator Roles

Administrator roles have full access to your accounts, including inviting additional admins and seeing developer keys.

<Note>
  The `accessToken` provided will remain valid for a duration of 24 hours.

## Guest Roles

Guest roles receive access via a magic link or a shared link depending on the [Environment](https://platform.flatfile.com/dashboard) `guestAuthentication` type. Guests roles can invite other Guests unless you turn off this setting in the [Guest Sidebar](/learning-center/guides/guest_sidebar).

<Note>
  The `accessToken` provided will remain valid for a duration of 1 hour.

### Space Grant

| Role                    | Details                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-Space&nbsp;Guest | This role is meant for a guest who has access to only one Space. Such guests can be invited to additional Spaces at any time.                                  |
| Multi-Space&nbsp;Guest  | This role is meant for a guest who has access to multiple Spaces. They will see a drop-down next to the Space name that enables them to switch between Spaces. |

### Workbook Grant

| Role                       | Details                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single-Workbook&nbsp;Guest | This role is meant for a guest who should have access to only one Workbook within a Space. |
| Multi-Workbook&nbsp;Guest  | This role is intended for a guest who has access to multiple Workbooks within a Space.     |

<Info>This role can only be configured using code. See code example.</Info>

```js
const createGuest = await api.guests.create({
  environmentId: "us_env_hVXkXs0b",
  email: "guest@example.com",
  name: "Mr. Guest",
  spaces: [
    {
      id: "us_sp_DrdXetPN",
      workbooks: [
        {
          id: "us_wb_qGZbKwDW",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Guest Permissions

Guest permissions can be configured at different levels:

#### Space-Level Guest
A guest with Space-level access can:
- View and access the Space
- See all Workbooks they have been granted access to
- View the Space sidebar (if enabled)
- Access the data checklist (if enabled)
- Upload files (if permitted)
- View Documents (if accessible)

#### Workbook-Level Guest
A guest with Workbook-level access can only:
- Access specific Workbooks they've been granted access to
- View and interact with Sheets within those Workbooks
- Execute allowed Actions within those Workbooks

### Sheet-Level Access Controls

Within Sheets, guests can be granted specific permissions through the Blueprint configuration:

```json
{
  "sheets": [{
    "name": "Contacts",
    "access": ["add", "edit", "delete", "import"]
  }]
}
```

Available Sheet permissions:
- `"add"`: Create new records
- `"edit"`: Modify existing records
- `"delete"`: Remove records
- `"import"`: Import data from files
- Empty array (`[]`): Read-only access

### Field-Level Access

Individual fields can be marked as read-only using the `readonly` property:

```json
{
  "fields": [{
    "key": "email",
    "type": "string",
    "readonly": true
  }]
}
```

### Guest Lifecycle

When a guest user is deleted, all their space connections are automatically removed to ensure security. This means:
- The guest loses access to all previously connected spaces
- They cannot regain access to these spaces without being explicitly re-invited

This automatic cleanup ensures that deleted guests cannot retain any access to spaces, even if they are later recreated with the same email address.

## Common Guest Restrictions

Guests typically cannot:
- Modify Space configurations
- Change Blueprint settings
- Access or modify Space secrets
- View or modify other guests' permissions
- Access Spaces or Workbooks they haven't been explicitly granted access to
- Modify read-only fields
- Execute restricted Actions

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Grant only the permissions necessary for the task
   - Use read-only fields for sensitive data
   - Restrict unnecessary Actions

2. **Clear Access Patterns**
   - Group related permissions logically
   - Document permission changes
   - Maintain consistent access patterns across similar Spaces

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Review guest access periodically
   - Remove unnecessary permissions
   - Update access controls as needs change

## Checking Permissions

To check a user's permissions within a Space:
1. Verify their role (Administrator or Guest)
2. Check their access grants (Space or Workbook level)
3. Review Sheet-level access controls in the Blueprint
4. Check for any read-only field restrictions
