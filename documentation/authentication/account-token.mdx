## Overview

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) provide a secure way to authenticate with the Flatfile API. Unlike environment-specific API keys, PATs are user-scoped tokens that inherit the permissions of the user who created them.

Personal Access Tokens:
- Are user-scoped authentication tokens
- Have the same auth scope as the user who created them
- Can be used in place of a JWT for API authentication
- Are ideal for scripts, automation, and integrations that need to act on behalf of a user

This opens up possibilities for various use cases, including building audit logs, managing Spaces, and monitoring agents across environments.

## Managing Personal Access Tokens

### Creating a Token

1. Log in to your Flatfile account
2. Click on your user profile dropdown in the top-right corner
3. Select "Personal Access Tokens"
4. Click "Create Token"
5. Enter a descriptive name for your token
6. Copy the generated token immediately - it will only be shown once

<Note>
  Make sure to copy your token when it's first created. For security reasons, you won't be able to view the token again after leaving the page.
</Note>

### Retrieving a Personal Access Token (Legacy Method)

Your `publishableKey` and `secretKey` are specific to an environment. Therefore, to interact at a higher level, you can use a personal access token.

1. From the dashboard, open **Settings**
2. Click to **Personal Tokens**
3. Retrieve your `clientId` and `secret`.

4. Using the key pair, call the auth endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/auth -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"clientId":"1234-1234", "secret":"1234-1234"}'
```

5. The response will include an `accessToken`. Present that as your **Bearer `token`** in place of the `secretKey`.

### Using a Token

Use your Personal Access Token in API requests by including it in the Authorization header.

### Listing Tokens

You can view all your active tokens in the Personal Access Tokens page. For each token, you can see:
- Name
- Creation date
- Last used date (if applicable)

### Deleting Tokens

To delete a token:
1. Navigate to the Personal Access Tokens page
2. Find the token you want to delete
3. Click the menu icon (three dots) next to the token
4. Select "Delete"
5. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a token immediately revokes access for any applications or scripts using it. Make sure you update any dependent systems before deleting a token.
</Warning>

## Retrieving Account-Level Objects

With the obtained Personal Access Token, you can use it as a Bearer token in place of the `secretKey` to perform account-level queries. This allows you access to every object across the Account.

By using the personal access token, you can query for all events across all environments, list all users and guests, determine the number of Spaces and their presence in different environments, and identify environments with agents deployed.

## Example Use Cases

### Building an Audit Log

Query for all events across all environments and combine them with user and guest data to create a comprehensive audit log, providing a detailed history of actions within the application.

### Managing Spaces Across Environments

Determine the number of Spaces available and identify which Spaces exist in different environments, allowing you to efficiently manage and organize your data.

### Monitoring Agents Across Environments

Keep track of agents deployed to various environments by retrieving information about their presence, ensuring smooth and efficient data import processes.

## Best Practices

- Create separate tokens for different applications or use cases
- Use descriptive names that identify where the token will be used
- Regularly review and delete unused tokens
- Rotate tokens periodically for enhanced security
- Never share your tokens with others - each user should create their own tokens
