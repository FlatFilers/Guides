# FlatfileProvider Component Overview

`FlatfileProvider` is a context provider for the `@flatfile/react` package that
wraps your application's components where Flatfile's import functionality will
be used. It initializes and provides the Flatfile import system to its child
components.

## Main Props

- `publishableKey`: The key provided by Flatfile to authenticate your
  application.
- `accessToken`: An alternative to `publishableKey` for authentication,
  typically used for server-side operations.
- `children`: React nodes for nested components, which can include `Space`,
  `Workbook`, or `Sheet` components.
- `config`: An object containing configuration options for the FlatfileProvider.
  - `externalActorId`: An optional unique identifier that enables our embedded
    users to be associated with a specific actor in flatfile, enabling repeated
    through the embedded experience.

Example usage:

```jsx
<FlatfileProvider publishableKey="your-publishable-key">
  <YourComponent />
</FlatfileProvider>
```

This setup allows you to manage and interact with Flatfile imports seamlessly
across your application.
