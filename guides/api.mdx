Flatfile maintains an NPM Package (@flatfile/api) for use in record-hooks, jobs,
and more.

### Overview

The Flatfile API can be imported into your scripts and used to make any REST calls
related to Flatfile Resources. The package can be found at
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/api), and the specific calls
available can be found at [reference.flatfile.com](reference.flatfile.com).

### Usage

First, install the package in your project, and import it at the top of your script

```bash
  npm i --save @flatfile/api@latest
```

```js
  import api from @flatfile/api
```

Also, make sure your secret key is included in your environment variables as
`FLATFILE_API_KEY`. If you aren't using environment variables via .env, you can
instantiate a new `FlatfileClient` by passing in your secret key as the token.

<Warning>
  Make sure to keep your secret key safe, as it can be used to access potentially
  sensitive information.
</Warning>

```ts
  const flatfileClient = new FlatfileClient({token: 'sk_your_secret_key'});
```

Now if you want to make a call, use the api object to create your call. The api
calls are async, so ensure that your code is compatible. For example, if you
wanted to get a specific sheet, you can do as follows:

<CodeGroup>

```ts async/await
  const sheet = await api.sheets.get("us_sh_your_sheet_id")
```

```ts using then()
  api.sheets.get("us_sh_your_sheet_id").then((res)=> console.log(res.data))
```

</CodeGroup>

A more complete example would look something like this workbook submission:

```ts
  listener.on(
    "job:ready",
    { job: "workbook:submitActionFg" },
    async (event) => {
      const { jobId, workbookId } = event.context;
      const { payload } = event;
      const { data: workbook } = await api.workbooks.get(workbookId);
      const { data: workbookSheets } = await api.sheets.list({ workbookId });
      const sheets = [];
      for (const [_, element] of workbookSheets.entries()) {
        const { data: records } = await api.records.get(element.id);
        sheets.push({
          ...element,
          ...records,
        });
      }

      try {
        await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
          info: "Starting job to submit action to webhook.site",
          progress: 10,
        });

        if (!sheets[0].records || sheets[0].records.length <= 0) {
          throw {
            message:
              "No records in Customers found, click the link to go to the sheet and add some data:",
            sheet: sheets[0],
            data: {
              WEBHOOK_SITE_URL: process.env.WEBHOOK_SITE_URL,
            },
          };
        }
        if (!sheets[1].records || sheets[1].records.length <= 0) {
          throw {
            message:
              "No records in Repairs found, click the link to go to the sheet and add some data: ",
            sheet: sheets[1],
            data: {
              WEBHOOK_SITE_URL: process.env.WEBHOOK_SITE_URL,
            },
          };
        }

        const webhookReceiver =
          process.env.WEBHOOK_SITE_URL ||
          "https://webhook.site/d61eade4-baa0-49f1-b995-ca138514b1e4";

        const response = await axios.post(
          webhookReceiver,
          {
            ...payload,
            method: "axios",
            workbook: {
              ...workbook,
              sheets,
            },
          },
          {
            headers: {
              "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
          },
        );

        if (response.status === 200) {
          const rejections = response.data.rejections;
          if (rejections) {
            const totalRejectedRecords = await responseRejectionHandler(rejections);
            await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {

                },
                message: `Data was submission was partially successful. ${totalRejectedRecords} record(s) were rejected.`,
              },
            });
          }
          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
            outcome: {
              message:
                "Data was successfully submitted to webhook.site. Go check it out at " +
                webhookReceiver +
                ".",
            },
          });
        } else {
          throw {
            message: "Data was not submitted to webhook.site",
            data: {
              WEBHOOK_SITE_URL: process.env.WEBHOOK_SITE_URL,
            },
          };
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(`webhook.site[error]:`, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(error)));

        const spaceId = error?.sheet?.id ? error.sheet.id : undefined;
        const jobBody: Flatfile.JobCompleteDetails  = {
          outcome: {
