Flatfile maintains an NPM Package (@flatfile/api) for use in record-hooks, jobs,
and more.

### Overview

The Flatfile API can be imported into your scripts and used to make any REST calls
related to Flatfile Resources. The package can be found at
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/api), and the specific calls
available can be found at [API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com).

### Usage

First, install the package in your project, and import it at the top of your script

```bash
  npm i --save @flatfile/api@latest
```

```js
  import api from '@flatfile/api'
```

Also, make sure your secret key is included in your environment variables as
`FLATFILE_API_KEY`. If you aren't using environment variables via .env, you can
instantiate a new `FlatfileClient` by passing in your secret key as the token.

<Warning>
  Make sure to keep your secret key safe, as it can be used to access
  potentially sensitive information.
</Warning>

```ts
const flatfileClient = new FlatfileClient({ token: "sk_your_secret_key" });
```

Now if you want to make a call, use the api object to create your call. The api
calls are async, so ensure that your code is compatible. For example, if you
wanted to get a specific sheet, you can do as follows:

<CodeGroup>

```ts async/await
const sheet = await api.sheets.get("us_sh_your_sheet_id");
```

```ts using then()
api.sheets.get("us_sh_your_sheet_id").then((res) => console.log(res.data));
```

</CodeGroup>

A more complete example would look something like this workbook submission:

```ts
listener.on("job:ready", { job: "workbook:submitActionFg" }, async (event) => {
  const { jobId, workbookId } = event.context;
  const { payload } = event;
  const { data: workbook } = await api.workbooks.get(workbookId);
  const { data: workbookSheets } = await api.sheets.list({ workbookId });
  const sheets = [];
  for (const [_, element] of workbookSheets.entries()) {
    const { data: records } = await api.records.get(element.id);
    sheets.push({
      ...element,
      ...records,
    });
  }

  try {
    await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
      info: "Starting job to submit action to webhook.site",
      progress: 10,
    });

    if (!sheets[0].records || sheets[0].records.length <= 0) {
      throw {
        message:
          "No records in Customers found, click the link to go to the sheet and add some data:",
        sheet: sheets[0],
        data: {
          WEBHOOK_SITE_URL: process.env.WEBHOOK_SITE_URL,
        },
      };
    }
    if (!sheets[1].records || sheets[1].records.length <= 0) {
      throw {
        message:
          "No records in Repairs found, click the link to go to the sheet and add some data: ",
        sheet: sheets[1],
        data: {
          WEBHOOK_SITE_URL: process.env.WEBHOOK_SITE_URL,
        },
      };
    }

    const webhookReceiver =
      process.env.WEBHOOK_SITE_URL ||
      "https://webhook.site/d61eade4-baa0-49f1-b995-ca138514b1e4";

    const response = await axios.post(
      webhookReceiver,
      {
        ...payload,
        method: "axios",
        workbook: {
          ...workbook,
          sheets,
        },
      },
      {
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
      }
    );

    if (response.status === 200) {
      const rejections = response.data.rejections;
      if (rejections) {
        const totalRejectedRecords = await responseRejectionHandler(rejections);
        await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
          outcome: {
            next: {
              type: "id",
              id: rejections.id,
              label: "See rejections...",
            },
            message: `Data was submission was partially successful. ${totalRejectedRecords} record(s) were rejected.`,
          },
        });
      }
      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          message:
            "Data was successfully submitted to webhook.site. Go check it out at " +
            webhookReceiver +
            ".",
        },
      });
    } else {
      throw {
        message: "Data was not submitted to webhook.site",
        data: {
          WEBHOOK_SITE_URL: process.env.WEBHOOK_SITE_URL,
        },
      };
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`webhook.site[error]:`, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(error)));

    const spaceId = error?.sheet?.id ? error.sheet.id : undefined;
    const jobBody: Flatfile.JobCompleteDetails = {
      outcome: {
        message: error.message,
        acknowledge: true,
      },
    };
    if (spaceId) {
      jobBody.outcome.next = {
        type: "id",
        id: spaceId,
      };
    }
    await api.jobs.fail(jobId, jobBody);
  }
});
```
