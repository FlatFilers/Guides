OUTLINE

## Before you begin
- sign up for the new platform
- talk about environments
- talk about spaces??

## Common things with new faces
- Workbooks - differences and similarities with workbooks
- Sheets - differences and similarities
- Fields and Data types differences and similarities

## Things that moved
- Data Hooks - talk about listeners and how they work
- Portal? Not sure if this goes here or above when we talk about spaces ðŸ¤”

## Using GraphQL?
- This likely needs to speak to the customers using the GraphQL API and explain why we no longer offer GraphQL and how it's all REST and point to the API docs (they all hated having to use GraphQL anyway)
