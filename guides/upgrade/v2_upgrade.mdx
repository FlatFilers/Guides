## Overview

When you're moving from Portal 2.0 to Platform, you'll notice a bunch of stuff that's pretty much the same as before. But there are also things that might be missing now, or they've been shifted around, or they've got a whole new look. This guide is here to make things easy for you. It'll show you all the stuff that's alike and different between the two versions, so you can switch over without any trouble.

## New Concepts

Take a look at this diagram that shows how the two products are different. Keep in mind, Platform has a bunch of extra and new ideas compared to Portal. But don't worry, you don't have to use all these new things to switch your existing importer to Platform.

### Meet the Workbook

For Platform, it's a good idea to get to know the [concept of a Workbook](/quickstart/meet-the-workbook). When you're upgrading, you can think of a Workbook as the place where your import data hangs out.

Unlike Portal, where all the editing and fixing of data happens right in the browser, Platform does these actions on the server side. The data gets saved in one or more Workbooks as you go along.

Inside these Workbooks, you'll find one or more Sheets, kind of like how Portal has its schemas. Other than some basic names and settings, the sheet has something called a "fields array," which is pretty similar to what you know from Portal.

### Understand Environments

In Portal, setting `devMode: true` flagged imports as “dev” imports, but in Platform, there are true Environments.

You can have many custom Environments, but upon signup, you will have a Development, Production and Example Environment configured already.

All of the other entities (like a Workbook and Sheet) will live in those Environments.

### Meet the Blueprint

Back in Portal, when you received diverse data from the same users and wished to merge it afterward, you had to establish distinct Portal configurations and display the appropriate one for each file. However, leveraging Blueprints offers a more streamlined approach. You can employ a collection of Sheets (akin to the schemas you constructed in Portal) within a Workbook. This simplifies the process of centralizing all your data structures and collating the information cohesively. The added advantage is that you're no longer burdened with managing multiple uploads from various schemas.

## Begin the migration

To facilitate your initiation and for testing, we'll leverage the API alongside a straightforward cURL request towards the end. This process will aid in crafting a Workbook that closely mirrors your Portal setup. We'll follow a step-by-step approach resembling a 1-to-1 transition. Do keep in mind, though, that you have the flexibility to consolidate various schema types into a single Blueprint within the Workbook.

### 1. Create a Workbook

To get started, let's begin by creating a Workbook and then progressively enhancing it. The workbook consists of three crucial components: the `name`, the `environmentId` (which you can locate in your [login here](https://platform.flatfile.com)), and the `sheets` properties.

```json
{
  "name": "Portal to Platform upgrade",
  "environmentId": "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID_HERE",
  "sheets": []
}
```

### 2. Create Sheet(s)

Let's take a closer look at Sheets, as this is where the bulk of your upgrade work will occur. Sheets will share many properties with those found in the Portal schema. You'll encounter a `name` property (akin to the `type` property in a Portal schema) and `fields` (which closely resembles your Portal `fields` array).

```json
{
  "name": "Portal to Platform upgrade",
  "environmentId": "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID_HERE",
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contacts",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "fields": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Create Fields

When it comes to the `fields` array, you'll find quite a few familiar elements like `key`, `label`, and `description`, which all transition directly from Portal. In this scenario, we're upgrading from one of our Demos in Portal, and you can track the process in this [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/sales-demo-v5-ef7kj?file=/src/schemas.js) if you'd like to follow along.

```json
{
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contacts",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "firstName",
          "label": "First Name"
        },
        {
          "key": "lastName",
          "label": "Last Name"
        },
        {
          "key": "email",
          "label": "Email Address",
          "description": "Please please enter your email"
        },
        {
          "key": "phone",
          "label": "Phone number"
        },
        {
          "key": "date",
          "label": "Date"
        },
        {
          "key": "country",
          "label": "Country"
        },
        {
          "key": "zipCode",
          "label": "Zip Code"
        },
        {
          "key": "subscriber",
          "label": "Subscriber"
        },
        {
          "key": "type",
          "label": "Deal Status"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### About field Types

Let's delve deeper into the Portal and Platform `type` property for fields. When you don't specify this field, both Portal and Platform will assume a default `string` type. In Portal, the `type: "checkbox"` is now `"type": "boolean"`, and the `type: "select"` is now `"type": "enum"` in Platform.

Furthermore, keep in mind that while Portal only had three types, Platform has broadened its range to include `number`, `date`, and `reference` types. To get more details about these new field types, you can check out our [documentation](/blueprint/field-types). Also, we've prepared a handy reference table below, outlining all the new types and how they were handled in Portal.

| Portal Type | Platform Type |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| String      | String        |
| String      | Date          |
| String      | Number        |
| Select      | Enum          |
| Checkbox    | Boolean       |
| N/A         | Reference     |

Before adding onto the example, note that when providing you select/enum options there is still an `options` array that is shaped exactly the same as before, however, one thing to note is that this options array has been moved into a new field that is `config` for Platform. This `config` property also comes into play if you want to have your checkbox/boolean fields behave the same as in Portal. In Portal, it would only allow truthy/falsy values and convert them into booleans. `null` was handled as a false value in Portal. In Platform, the default is to pass through `null` values and `null`. If you want to handle these as `false` , like in Portal, use the `config` object with the `allow_indeterminate` set to `false`.

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "key": "date",
      "type": "date",
      "label": "Date"
    },
    {
      "key": "subscriber",
      "type": "boolean",
      "label": "Subscriber",
      "config": {
        "allow_indeterminate": false
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "type",
      "type": "enum",
      "label": "Deal Status",
      "config": {
        "options": [
          { "label": "New", "value": "new" },
          { "label": "Interested", "value": "interested" },
          { "label": "Meeting", "value": "meeting" },
          { "label": "Opportunity", "value": "opportunity" },
          { "label": "Not a fit", "value": "unqualified" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Setup validations

The final aspect of converting your Portal fields into Platform fields will be to handle the `validators` from Portal. While Portal offered many different kinds of validators, only two have been converted in the fields themselves, and those are `required` and `unique`. All other validations may still be handled, but would be handled in code instead of a setting.

The `validators` property will now be called `constraints` which is still an array of objects. The object for each validator has traded in the `validates` property for `type` property, but the `unique` and `required` values remain the same.

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "key": "firstName",
      "type": "string",
      "label": "First Name",
      "constraints": [{ "type": "required" }]
    },
    {
      "key": "email",
      "type": "string",
      "label": "Email Address",
      "description": "Please please enter your email",
      "constraints": [{ "type": "unique" }, { "type": "required" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Send API Request

We have now learned all the aspects of converting your Portal schema to the Platform.

Below, we will take all the aspects of what gets converted above and put it into a full request that works.

<Note>
  {" "}
  You'll need your your Secret Key and your Environment Id from your [Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com).
</Note>

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/workbooks \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "Portal to Platform upgrade",
  "environmentId": "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID",
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contact",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "firstName",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "First Name",
          "constraints": [
            { "type": "required" }
          ]
        },
        {
          "key": "lastName",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Last Name"
        },
        {

          "constraints": [
            { "type": "unique" }
          ]
        },
        {
          "key": "phone",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Phone number"
        },
        {
          "key": "date",
          "type": "date",
          "label": "Date"
        },
        {
          "key": "country",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Country"
        },
        {
          "key": "zipCode",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Zip Code"
        },
        {
          "key": "subscriber",
          "type": "boolean",
          "label": "Subscriber",
          "config": {
            "allow_indeterminate": false
          }
        },
        {
          "key": "type",
          "type": "enum",
          "label": "Deal Status",
          "config": {
            "options":[
              { "label": "New", "value": "new" },
              { "label": "Interested", "value": "interested" },
              { "label": "Meeting", "value": "meeting" },
              { "label": "Opportunity", "value": "opportunity" },
              { "label": "Not a fit", "value": "unqualified" }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```
