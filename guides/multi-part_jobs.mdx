## What the hell is a Job Part?

A Job can be split up into multiple parts depending on the intended functionality. This can help spread out large data sets or long tasks across many separate listeners.
When a job is split up into parts, the original part is considered the "parent" part and it's children are considered "parts". Each Part is considered it's own separate Job and has the full ecosystem of events attached to it. 
When all Job Parts have been completed, a new event `job:parts-completed` is emitted, so that you can listen for that event to complete the Parent Job.

Here's an example of a listener that creates parts and waits for the `job:parts-completed` event:

Here's an example of a listener that does logic on each Part:
