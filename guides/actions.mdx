An Action is a code-based operation that runs where that Action is mounted. Actions run when a user clicks the corresponding user prompt in Flatfile.

## Overview

Workbook & Sheet-mounted Actions are configured within a <Tooltip tip="A Data Definition Language...">Blueprint</Tooltip> object, while File-mounted actions are appended to the file during the upload process.

The executable code within an Action is compiled into a <Tooltip tip="Large asynchronous work...">Job</Tooltip> entity, providing the capability to run asynchronously or immediately.

Sheet-mounted actions can be executed on the entire Sheet, for a filtered view of the Sheet, or selectively for the chosen records.

## Workbook-mounted

Once a user has extracted and mapped data into a <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](../concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip>, it may be more efficient to run an operation on the entire dataset rather than making atomic transformations at the record- or field-level.

For example:

- Sending a webhook that notifies your API of the data's readiness
- Populating a Sheet with data from another source
- Adding two different fields together after a user review's initial validation checks
- Moving valid data from an editable Sheet to a read-only Sheet

Workbook-mounted actions are represented as buttons in the top right of the Workbook.

### Usage

Listen for a `job:ready` and filter on the `job` you'd like to process. Be sure to complete the job when it's complete.

<Info>
  If you configure `primary: true` on an Action, it will be represented as the
  rightmost button in the Workbook.

## Sheet-mounted

<Info>Each Sheet has built-in Actions like download.</Info>

Sheet-mounted actions are represented as a dropdown in the toolbar of the Sheet.

### Usage

Listen for a `job:ready` and filter on the `domain` (sheet) and the `operation` of where the action was placed. Be sure to complete to job when it's complete.

<CodeGroup>

```jsx sheet.js
sheets : [
  {
    name: "Sheet Name",
    actions: [
      {
        operation: 'capitalizeNamesBg',
        mode: 'background',
        label: 'Capitalize selected names',
        type: 'string',
        description: 'Capitalize names for selected rows',
        primary: true,
      },
      {...}
    ]
  }
]
```

```jsx listener.js
listener.filter({ job: "sheet:capitalizeNamesBg" }, (configure) => {
  configure.on("job:ready", async ({ context: { jobId } }) => {
    try {
      await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
        info: "Getting started.",
        progress: 10,
      });

      // Do your work here

      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        info: "This job is now complete.",
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error.stack);

      await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
        info: "This job did not work.",
      });
    }
  });
});
```

```jsx listener.ts
listener.filter({ job: "sheet:capitalizeNamesBg" }, (configure: FlatfileListener) => {
  configure.on("job:ready", async ({ context: { jobId } }: FlatfileEvent) => {
    try {
      await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
        info: "Getting started.",
        progress: 10,
      });

      // Do your work here

      await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        info: "This job is now complete.",
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error.stack);

      await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
        info: "This job did not work.",
      });
    }
  });
});

```

### Retrieving data

Data from the Sheet can be retrieved either by calling the API with `records.get` or through data passed in through `event.data`. Here are some examples demonstrating how you can extract data from a Sheet-mounted action:

#### From the entire Sheet

This method allows you to access and process data from the complete Sheet, regardless of the current view or selected records.

```jsx
//inside listener.on()

  const { jobId, sheetId } = event.context;

  //retrieve all records from sheet
  const { records } = await api.records.get(sheetId);

  //print records
  console.log(records.data.records)

```

#### From a filtered view of the Sheet

By applying filters to the Sheet, you can narrow down the data based on specific criteria. This enables you to retrieve and work with a subset of records that meet the defined filter conditions.

`event.data` returns a promise resolving to an object with a records property so we extract the records property directly from the event.data object.

<Warning>If rows are selected, only the corresponding records will be passed through the event for further processing.</Warning>

```jsx
//inside listener.on()
  const { jobId } = event.context;
  const { records } = await event.data;

  try {
    if (!records || records.length === 0) {
      console.log("No rows were selected or in view.");
      await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          message: "No rows were selected or in view, please try again.",
        },
      });
      return;
    }

    //print records
    console.log(records)

    await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          message:
            'Records were printed to console, check it out.',
        },
      })
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error, null, 2)}`)

    await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message:
          "This action failed, check logs.",
      },
    })
  }
```

#### For chosen records

When rows are selected, `event.data` will only extract information exclusively for the chosen records, providing focused data retrieval for targeted analysis or operations.

`event.data` returns a promise resolving to an object with a records property so we extract the records property directly from the event.data object.

<Note>This code is the same as the filtered view of the Sheet.</Note>

```jsx
//inside listener.on()
  const { jobId } = event.context;
  const { records } = await event.data;

  try {
    if (!records || records.length === 0) {
      console.log("No rows were selected or in view.");
      await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          message: "No rows were selected or in view, please try again.",
        },
      });
      return;
    }

    //print records
    console.log(records)

    await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
        outcome: {
          message:
            'Records were printed to console, check it out.',
        },
      })
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error, null, 2)}`)

    await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message:
          "This action failed, check logs.",
      },
    })
  }
```

## File-mounted

<Info>Each file has built-in actions like Delete and Download.</Info>

File-mounted actions are represented as a dropdown menu for each file in the Files list. You can attach additional actions to a File.

![file actions](../images/actions/file_actions.png)

### Usage

Listen for a `file:ready` and one or more actions to the file. Next, listen for `job:ready` and filter on the `domain` (file) and the `operation` of where the Action was placed. Be sure to complete to job when it's complete.

<CodeGroup>

```jsx listener.js file:ready
listener.on("file:created", async ({ context: { fileId } }) => {
  const file = await api.files.get(fileId);
  const actions = file.data?.actions || [];
  const newActions = [
    ...actions,
    {
      operation: "logFileContents",
      label: "Log File Metadata",
      description: "This will log the file metadata.",
    },
    {
      operation: "decryptAction",
      label: "Decrypt File",
      description: "This will create a new decrypted file.",
    },
  ];
  await api.files.update(fileId, {
    actions: newActions,
  });
});
```

```jsx listener.ts file:ready
listener.on("file:created", async ({ context: { fileId } }: FlatfileEvent) => {
  const file = await api.files.get(fileId);
  const actions = file.data?.actions || [];
  const newActions = [
    ...actions,
    {
      operation: "logFileContents",
      label: "Log File Metadata",
      description: "This will log the file metadata.",
    },
    {
      operation: "decryptAction",
      label: "Decrypt File",
      description: "This will create a new decrypted file.",
    },
  ];
  await api.files.update(fileId, {
    actions: newActions,
  });
});
```

```jsx listener.js job:ready
//when the button is clicked in the file dropdown

listener.filter({ job: "file:logFileContents" }, (configure) => {
  configure.on("job:ready", async ({ context: { fileId, jobId } }) => {
    await acknowledgeJob(jobId, "Gettin started.", 10);

    const file = await api.files.get(fileId);
    console.log({ file });

    await completeJob(jobId, "Logging file contents is complete.");
  });
});

  configure.on("job:ready", async ({ context: { spaceId, fileId, jobId, environmentId } }) => {
    try {

      const fileResponse = await api.files.get(fileId);

      const buffer = await getFileBufferFromApi(fileId);
      const { name, ext } = fileResponse.data;
      const newFileName = name
        ? name.split(".")[0] + "[Decrypted]." + ext
        : "DecryptedFile.csv";

      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append("file", buffer, { filename: newFileName });
      formData.append("spaceId", spaceId);
      formData.append("environmentId", environmentId);

      await uploadDecryptedFile(formData);

      await completeJob(jobId, "Decrypting is now complete.");
    } catch (e) {
      await failJob(jobId, "The decryption job failed.");
    }
  });
});

async function acknowledgeJob(jobId: string, info: string, progress: number) {
