### Usage

A key component of Flatfile's headless automation workflow is the automapping functionality provided by our [Automap Plugin](../plugins/automations/automap).

Upon uploading a file, after file extraction is complete, the data needs to be mapped to a destination Workbook. In a non-headless environment a human might do this manually. But in a headless environment, we'll automate this process.

We'll use Automap to do this for us.

### Install

First, add the plugin to your project.

<Snippet file="guides/automap/block1.mdx" />

### Configure

Next, configure the plugin. Choose an accuracy level, a default target sheet, and a regex expression to test incoming files.

**accuracy:** either `confident` or `exact` \
**defaultTargetSheet:** the name of the sheet you want to map to \
**matchFilename:** regex that will match on incoming files

<Snippet file="guides/automap/block2.mdx" />

<Note>
  Note you may also set `debug` to true for useful error messages in development.
</Note>

### Deploy and watch it work

Add your configured listener to your project and deploy it to Flatfile.

<Snippet file="guides/automap/block3.mdx" />

Upload a file and head over to your dashboard to see your you data automapped and ready to use!
