**Data Hooks&reg;** are concise functions that automatically **re-format**, **correct**, **validate**, and **enrich** data during the data import process. These hooks can be executed on a complete record, or row, of data using methods on the `FlatfileRecord` class.

Record-level hooks have access to all fields in a row and should be utilized for operations that require access to multiple fields or when creating a new field.

## Getting started

Listen for updates to data records, and respond with three types of record hooks: `compute`, `computeIfPresent`, and `validate`. These hooks are available as methods on the `FlatfileRecord` class.

```ts
import { FlatfileRecord } from '@flatfile/hooks'
```

## Methods

### `FlatfileRecord.compute`

Computes a new value for a field based on its original value or other field values on the record. Optionally pass a message to surface to the user about the transformation. `compute` will run even when no value is set for the field (see [`computeIfPresent`](#flatfilerecord-computeifpresent)).

#### Syntax

```ts
FlatfileRecord.compute(fieldName, transformation, message)
```

<ParamField path="fieldName" type="string">
  The name of the field to transform.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="transformation" type="(value, record) => string | number | boolean | null">
  The transformation to perform on the field value. Receives the intial value of the field, as well as the entire record if you want to access other field values on the record.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  (optional) a message to show on the cell after the transformation.
</ParamField>

#### Example

Generate email from first and last name:

```ts
client.use(
  recordHook('contacts', (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
    record.compute(
      'email',
      (email, record) => {
        return `${record.get('firstName') + record.get('lastName)}@gmail.com`
      },
      // optional
      'Email was generated from first and last name.'
    )
    return record
  })
)
```

### `FlatfileRecord.computeIfPresent`

Same as [`compute`](#flatfilerecord-compute), but only computes a new value if an initial value is provided (not null). Useful for computations that may throw an error on null values.

#### Syntax

```ts
FlatfileRecord.computeIfPresent(fieldName, transformation, message)
```

<ParamField path="fieldName" type="string">
  The name of the field to transform.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="transformation" type="(value, record) => string | number | boolean | null">
  The transformation to perform on the field value. Receives the intial value of the field, as well as the entire record if you want to access other field values on the record.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  (optional) a message to show on the cell after the transformation.
</ParamField>

#### Example

Change email to lower case:

```ts
client.use(
  recordHook('contacts', (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
    record.computeIfPresent(
      'email',
      (email) => email.toLowerCase(),
      // optional
      'Email was converted to lower case.'
    )
    return record
  })
)
```

### `FlatfileRecord.validate`

Sets a field as invalid if its value does not meet a specified condition, and displays a message to the user.

#### Syntax

```ts
validate(fieldName, validator, message)
```

<ParamField path="fieldName" type="string">
  The name of the field to validate.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="validator" type="(value, record) => boolean">
  A function that determines whether a given field value is valid. Receives the intial value of the field, as well as the entire record if you want to access other field values on the record.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  A message to show on the cell if the field is invalid.
</ParamField>

#### Example

```ts
client.use(
  recordHook('contacts', (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
    record.validate(
      'lastName',
      (value) => !/\d/.test(value.toString()),
      'Last name cannot contain numbers'
    )
    return record
  })
)
```
