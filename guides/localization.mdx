Tailor the language and text in your Flatfile Space with ease! This guide will lead you step-by-step to allow you to both translate and personalize the text in your space in just a couple of simple steps.

## Setting Up Language Paths
To provide translations and text overrides you can use the translationsPath parameter. You have the flexibility to set up translationsPaths at two levels:
- **Space-Level:** Overrides the environment level setting.
- **Environment-Level:** Used when no space-level path is defined.

### Creating Your TranslationsPath

Your `translationsPath` must meet a few requirements to work as expected:
1. It must be a string that directs to a publicly available URL hosting your JSON translation files.
2. It must follow this folder structure:
    ```
    yourCustomTranslationsDirectory/
        └── locales/
            ├── en/
            │   └── translation.json
            ├── es/
            │   └── translation.json
            ...
    ```
    where `yourCustomTranslationsDirectory` can be swapped out for any path desired.
  3. Set your translationsPath to the path to your english json translation file. Don't have an english file? Just use any other language.


**Want to see how we did it?** 

Check our public [repository here](https://github.com/FlatFilers/Platform-Translations).
For our repository we would use the following translationsPath: 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlatFilers/Platform-Translations/main/locales/en/translation.json`

<Tip>
While creating your JSON translation files, you can opt for partial or full JSON objects:
 **Partial JSON Objects:** Maintain the JSON structure to avoid errors. Update only the values you wish to change.
**Full JSON Objects:** Copy the translation file from our public repository and modify the values as required.
</Tip>

## Implementing Translations Path

Set up your translations path using API or the listener, both at the space and environment levels.

## Available Languages

We support translations into these languages for now:

| Language |  Code  |
| -------- | ------ |
| English  | en     |
| French   | fr     |
| German   | de     |
| Spanish  | es     |

## Adding Regional Dialects

We automatically support regional dialects for every language supported above. 
To ensure a seamless user experience, always include a base file for each language (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr'), which will serve as a fallback for users from regions not specified in your translations list.

Extend your customization by setting up directories for different dialects as illustrated below:


```
yourTranslationsDirectory/
    └── locales/
        ├── en/
        │   └── translation.json
        ├── en-US/
        │   └── translation.json
        ...
```
