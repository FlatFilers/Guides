Documents are standalone webpages for your Flatfile <Tooltip tip="Are micro-applications...">[Spaces](../concepts/spaces)</Tooltip>. They can be rendered from <Tooltip tip="View syntax">[Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)</Tooltip>.

Often used for getting started guides, Documents become extremely powerful with dynamically generated content that stays updated as events occur.

<Info>
  Flatfile also allows you to use HTML tags in your Markdown-formatted text. This
  is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax.

    "### Say hello to your first customer Space in the new Flatfile!\n" +
    "Let's begin by first getting acquainted with what you're seeing in your Space initially.\n" +
    "---\n",
});
```
```ts listener.js
//listen for an event, and update your document to be relevant

listener.on("upload:completed", (event) => {
  const fileName = await api.files.get(event.context.fileId)
  const updateDoc = await api.documents.update(spaceId, documentId, {
    title: "Getting Started",
    body:
      "# Welcome\n" +
      "### Say hello to your first customer Space in the new Flatfile!\n" +
