<Snippet file='shared/dxpbanner.mdx' />

Documents are standalone webpages for your Flatfile <Tooltip tip="Are micro-applications...">[Spaces](../developer-tools/spaces)</Tooltip>. They can be rendered from <Tooltip tip="View syntax">[Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)</Tooltip>.

Often used for getting started guides, Documents become extremely powerful with dynamically generated content that stays updated as Events occur.

<Info>
  Flatfile also allows you to use HTML tags in your Markdown-formatted text.
  This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags rather than Markdown syntax.
</Info>

## Create a Document

You can create Documents using the API:

<Snippet file='guides/documents/create-document.mdx' />

This Document will now appear in the sidebar of your Space.

In this example, we create a Document when a file is uploaded, but you can also create Documents in response to any other Event. [Read more](../orchestration/events) about the different Events you can respond to.

## Document Actions

Actions are optional and allow you to run custom operations in response to a user-triggered event from within a Document.

Define Actions on a Document using the `actions` parameter when a document is created:

<Snippet file='guides/documents/document-actions.mdx' />

Then configure your listener to handle this Action, and define what should happen in response. Read more about Actions and how to handle them [here](./actions#document-mounted).

Actions appear as buttons in the top right corner of your Document:

![Document actions](../images/actions/document_actions.png)

## Document treatments

Documents have an optional `treatments` parameter which takes an array of treatments for your Document. Treatments can be used to categorize your Document. Certain treatments will cause your Document to look or behave differently.

### Ephemeral documents

Giving your Document a treatment of `"ephemeral"` will cause the Document to appear as a full-screen takeover, and it will not appear in the sidebar of your Space like other Documents. You can use ephemeral Documents to create a more focused experience for your end users.

```ts
const ephemeralDoc = await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
  title: 'Getting started',
  body: '# Welcome ...',
  treatments: ['ephemeral'],
})
```

<Info>
  Currently, `"ephemeral"` is the only treatment that will change the behavior
  of your Document. Other treatments will not affect how your Document behaves,
  but can be used for your own purposes to categorize and describe your
  Documents in code.
</Info>

## Adding Blocks to Documents

Blocks are dynamic, embedded entities that you can use to display data inside a Document. You can add a Block to a Document using the `<embed>` HTML entity in your markdown and specifying which Block type you want to show using the `type` attribute on the entity. Two Block types are currently supported: Embedded Sheet and Embedded Diff.

### Embedded Sheet

Use this Block to render a Sheet along with all its data inside of a Document. You can embed a Sheet into your Document by passing a sheet ID, workbook ID, and name. You can also specify whether the embedded Sheet is expanded or collapsed when the document is loaded.

<Info>
  You can include as many embedded Sheets in your Document as you like, but end
  users will only be able to expand a maximum of 10 embedded Sheets at once.
</Info>

```ts
const doc = await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
  title: 'Getting started',
  body: `
    # Welcome
    
    Here is an embedded Sheet:
    
    <embed type='embedded-sheet' name='Contacts' defaultExpanded='true' sheetId='your_sheet_id' workbookId='your_workbook_id'>

    Here is another embedded Sheet:

    <embed type='embedded-sheet' name='Countries' sheetId='us_sh_TVW95224' workbookId='us_wb_8e0z52gI'>
  `,
})
```

### Embedded Diff

Use this Block to show a side-by-side comparison of the data in a Sheet now versus at a previous point in time as captured by a Snapshot. Pass a Sheet ID, Workbook ID, and Snapshot ID. You can optionally pass a `direction` attribute which specified whether the changes are displayed with the Snapshot as the end state (`sheet_to_snapshot`) or the Sheet as the end state (`snapshot_to_sheet`). The default value for direction is `sheet_to_snapshot`.

<Info>
  Use `direction="sheet_to_snapshot"` if you want to show changes that have been
  made since the time the Snapshot was taken, i.e. to review past changes. Use
  `direction="snapshot_to_sheet"` if to preview the changes that would occur if
  you were to revert your Sheet back to the state it was in when the Snapshot
  was taken.
</Info>

```ts
const doc = await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
  title: 'Getting started',
  body: `
    # Welcome
    
    Here is an embedded Diff:
    
    <embed type='embedded-diff' sheetId='your_sheet_id' workbookId='your_workbook_id' snapshot_id='your_snapshot_id" direction="snapshot_to_sheet">
  `,
})
```

## Markdown reference

Documents support Github-flavored Markdown. Check out [this guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a full reference on the entities you can use.
