After your customers have imported their data, the process of transmitting that data to an external destination or network is referred to as "egress out."

## Egress via Workbook-level Action

This code listens for a job event of type `workbook:submitAction` and when triggered, it retrieves the Sheets and records associated with the workbook.

It then prepares the data and sends a `POST` request to a specified webhook URL using Axios. The payload includes information about the Sheets, records, and other relevant data.

If the request is successful, it marks the job as complete. If there is an error, it marks the job as failed.

#### Testing with webhook.site

1. To create the receiver, navigate to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site)
2. Copy the value of the path after webhook.site for `Your unique URL`.
3. Next, add the following to your default export function.

<Snippet file="shared/workbook_submit.mdx" />
