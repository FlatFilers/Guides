## The problem
If you're in the midst of a client-side only implementation, but you still need to accept Excel files, you've likely noticed the warning on the `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor` plugin that says it does not work client-side. XLS(X) files tend to have a level of complexity to them that make them hard to handle client-side. For the purposes of getting up and running, though, this is fine, because we can deploy just what we need to handle Excel files in a server-side listener, and that's just what we'll walk through now.

<Note>
    One thing to note here is that when we talk about "server-side listeners," we are not referring to you having to spin up a web server to run this code. We are talking about writing a listener file and then pushing that file to Flatfile to run on OUR servers on your behalf.
</Note>

## Before you begin
There are a couple of extra steps you'll need to take in order to deploy a listener. First, you'll need somewhere to write your listener code. This can be in your current application repository or you could create a new one, but this will need a couple of extra pieces if you have a simple `index.html` file your application runs from, like in this example.
1) You'll need to have a package.json file where you will install the `@flatfile/listener` and `@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor` packages (if you haven't already installed them).
2) You'll need a .env file that has a `FLATFILE_API_KEY` (which is labeled as your Secret Key in the dashboard) and `FLATFILE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` (which is the environment ID where you would like to deploy this listener).

So for the example I am showing here, your file structure might look something like this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
   â””â”€â”€ index.html
   â””â”€â”€ index.css
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â””â”€â”€ listener.js
â”œâ”€â”€ .env <--- already created
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json <--- already created
â””â”€â”€ package-lock.json <--- already created
```

## The Example Code

Here's a breakdown of what each of these files from above will look like when all is said and done:

                        output.value = JSON.stringify(data, " ", 2)
                        console.log('onSubmit', data)
                    },

                        if (firstName && !lastName) {

    ```

</CodeGroup>

Don't forget to put your Publishable Key and Environment ID in the index.html file and your Private Key and Environment ID into your .env file.

## Deploying to Flatfile
Once you have created your server-side listener code, like in the `src/listener.js` example above, you can then deploy to Flatfile. In the package.json, we've created a script that lets you run `npm run deploy` to deploy to Flatfile, but you can also deploy directly from your terminal by using this pattern: `npx flatfile deploy path/to/file`.

You'll now be able to spin up your client-side implementation and see that it will accept xls(s) files via that server-side listener we deployed.
