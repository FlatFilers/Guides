## Install the package

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
npm install @flatfile/javascript@latest
```

```yarn yarn
yarn add @flatfile/javascript@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Choose your path

First, decide if you want to start from scratch or work backwards from an existing project. Then, you'll encounter the choice of creating a new Space for each initialization or reusing an existing Space.

### Start from scratch

These Guides will walk you through setting up an embedded Flatfile Space from beginning to end. When configuring embedded Flatfile, you'll encounter the choice of creating a new Space for each initialization or reusing an existing Space.

    **Most Common** Consider this option when the data import/exchange is
    synchronous, and users complete the process in a single session. This is
    suitable for situations where you want to start with a clean slate for each
    interaction, without any previous data or context.

    Opt for this option when there's a possibility that users may need to wait
    or won't complete the process in a single session. This is ideal for
    scenarios where continuity and preserving the context of ongoing work are
    essential, allowing users to pick up where they left off until the process
    is completed.

### Start from an example project

Clone a full Javascript example project in the Flatfile GitHub repository. This project shows how to both create a new Space and reuse an existing Space.
