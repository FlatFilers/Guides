## Install the package

Install Embed Javascript from the npm/yarn public registry.

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
npm install @flatfile/javascript@latest
```

```yarn yarn
yarn add @flatfile/javascript@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Choose your path

First, decide if you want to start from scratch or work backwards from an existing project. Then, you'll encounter the choice of creating a new Space for each initialization or reusing an existing Space.

### Start from scratch

These Guides will walk you through setting up an embedded Flatfile Space from beginning to end. When configuring embedded Flatfile, you'll encounter the choice of creating a new Space for each initialization or reusing an existing Space.

    **Most Common** For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one
    session, create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits
    situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred.

    Choose this when users might need to wait or can't finish in one go. It's
    great for keeping work context and letting users continue where they left
    off until the task is done.

### Start from an example project

Clone a full Javascript example project in the Flatfile GitHub repository. This project shows how to both create a new Space and reuse an existing Space.
