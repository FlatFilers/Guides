## Who should use Portal?

If you have a simple data set (meaning just one sheet or schema), need to run simple validations on the data, think like date formatting, pattern matching, unique and required type of validations, and need a simple data egress, then this is the path forward for you. Does this not sound like what you need? Our Platform is flexible enough for you to build your own workflow. [Get started here.](https://flatfile.com/docs/overview)

## Getting Started

There’s 3 basic components of a Portal implementation.

1. Setup a basic app
2. Your sheet configuration
3. Your Data Validations
4. Your Data Egress

## Setup a Basic Web App

One of the best things about the most simple of Portal setups is that it will work in as simple of an environment as a single HTML file. To test in this sort of setup, you can create an html file and serve the file locally using the command `python3 -m http.server 8000`. This will use your computer’s python library to start a server and serve the html file at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Note: You may be used to using the file browser to double click and open the file in the browser to test your changes to an html file. While this works the majority of the time, the Flatfile iFrame won’t attach to a non-served version, so you will need to have a development server running locally and the easiest way is the above Python command.

There are a few things to note in the below code snippet that are the start of what we will be building onto in the following sections.

First, we’ve already included the script tag that is bringing in the Flatfile JavaScript SDK. The JavaScript SDK has a `startFlatfile` method we will call with the `flatfileOptions` object we’ve started creating below to start the Flatfile Portal import process.

Second thing to note is that the `publishableKey` and `environmentId` are coded into the button’s onclick as values you’ll need to pass into the flatfileOptions object in order to get this to run properly. You can obtain your publishable key and environment Id by logging into your Flatfile Dashboard [here](https://platform.flatfile.com).

The Basic HTML File:

<CodeGroup>
```html index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
    <script src="https://www.unpkg.com/@flatfile/javascript@latest/dist/index.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.openFlatfile = ({ publishableKey, environmentId }) => {
        const flatfileOptions = {
          publishableKey,
          environmentId,
        // more to come here in the following sections
        }
        window.FlatFileJavaScript.startFlatfile(flatfileOptions)
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>We are going to import your data now. Click the button below to start your import</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <button
        id="flatfileButton"
        onclick="openFlatfile({ publishableKey: 'YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY', environmentId: 'YOUR_ENV_ID'})"
      >
        Import Contacts
      </button>
    </div>
    <br>
  </body>
</html>
```
</CodeGroup>

## Configure your sheet

Configuring your sheet for Portal is telling us about the data you’re looking to receive and in what format. You can specify things like fields being required or unique so that some of the built-in validation can help expedite your data import.

A sheet contains 3 elements, a `name`, `slug` and your `fields`. We go over Fields in detail in our Blueprint guide, but in the below example, you will see that each field has a `key`, `type` and `label`. Some keys also use the `constraints` property to specify things like a field needing to be `required` to have a value or be a `unique` value in the field values. You might also notice in the below example that a field type of `enum` also using an additional `config` property where the `options` in the enum list will be defined.

Example sheet:

<CodeGroup>
```js index.html
const sheet = {
  name: 'Contacts',
    slug: 'contacts',
    fields: [
      {
        key: 'name',
        type: 'string',
        label: 'Name',
        constraints: [
          { type: 'required' }
        ]
      },
      {
        key: 'email',
        type: 'string',
        label: 'Email',
        constraints: [
          { type: 'required' },
          { type: 'unique' },
        ]
      },
    {
      key: 'age',
      type: 'number',
      label: 'Age',
    },
    {
      key: 'employmentStatus',
      type: 'boolean',
      label: 'Currently employed?',
    },
    {
      key: 'birthYear',
      type: 'enum',
      label: 'Birth Year',
      config: {
        options: [
          { value: '1999', label: '1999' },
          { value: '2000', label: '2000' },
          // more here
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Now that we’ve built out the sheet above, we can add it to the full example below. Notice that in addition to the above sheet being added into the script tag, we’ve also referenced the `sheet` in the `flatfileOptions`. Quick note: The `flatfileOptions` object does expect to get a `sheet` object with that name. So you can name your `sheet` whatever you like, but if your sheet is `const mySheet = {}` then you will just need your `flatfileOptions` object to look like `sheet: mySheet` instead.

Adding on to the Full Example:

        const sheet = {
          name: 'Contacts',
            slug: 'contacts',
            fields: [
            {
              key: 'name',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Name',
              constraints: [
                { type: 'required' }
              ]
            },
            {
              key: 'email',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Email',
              constraints: [
                { type: 'required' },
                { type: 'unique' },
              ]
            },
            {
              key: 'age',
              type: 'number',
              label: 'Age',
            },
            {
              key: 'employmentStatus',
              type: 'boolean',
              label: 'Currently employed?',
            },
            {
              key: 'birthYear',
              type: 'enum',
              label: 'Birth Year',
              config: {
                options: [
                  { value: '1999', label: '1999' },
                  { value: '2000', label: '2000' },
                  // more here
                ]
              }
            }
          ],
        }
        const flatfileOptions = {
          publishableKey,
          environmentId,
          sheet,
          // more to come here in the following sections
        }
        window.FlatFileJavaScript.startFlatfile(flatfileOptions)
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>We are going to import your data now. Click the button below to start your import</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <button
        id="flatfileButton"
        onclick="openFlatfile({ publishableKey: 'YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY', environmentId: 'YOUR_ENV_ID'})"
      >
        Import Contacts
      </button>
    </div>
    <br>
  </body>
</html>
```
</CodeGroup>

## Your Data Validations

Now that we have configured out Sheet, we will look at the Data Validations piece. Data Validations in the Portal setup can be written inside of the `onRecordHook` callback of the `flatfileOptions` object. This callback will run on each record at initialization and then on any subsequent changes of the data.

The callback you write will get the `record` passed in by default and you can update that record with any updates you’d like to make and return it as the output of the callback and that will update the record in the UI. For the purposes of being super basic in this example, let’s say you like to store the `name` property in your Database as all uppercase values. To ensure that this happens, we can write a simple function using JavaScript’s `toUpperCase` method to make sure all values continually get put to all uppercase values.

<CodeGroup>
```js index.html
// taking just the flatfileOptions object out from the full example
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  environmentId,
  sheet,
  onRecordHook: (record) => {
    const name = record.get('name')
    if (name) {
      record.set('name', name.toUpperCase())
      record.addInfo('name', 'We updated the values to all uppercase')
    }
    return record
  },
}
```
</CodeGroup>

What you’ll notice from the above is that we can use a built-in `record.get()` method with the fields key value to initially get the record’s value. We can then use the `record.set()` method to set the new value for the field and then we can optionally provide some context onto the record with `record.addInfo()` to set a message on the field.

Quick note on the additional info being added: You can add additional info on a field with several different validation levels. You can use `addInfo` as a courtesy to let your end use know what transformations is happening with the data, you could use `addWarning` to provide a warning message (the main difference between the two is how noticeable a field is after running the hook in the UI) and finally, you can use `addError` which not only highlights everything in red, but changes the data’s validation state to being not valid and making the end use fix the issue.

Here’s the above added to the full code snippet:

<CodeGroup>
```html index.html

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <script>
      window.openFlatfile = ({ publishableKey, environmentId }) => {
        const sheet = {
          name: 'Contacts',
          slug: 'contacts',
          fields: [
            {
              key: 'name',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Name',
              constraints: [
                { type: 'required' }
              ]
            },
            {
              key: 'email',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Email',
              constraints: [
                { type: 'required' },
                { type: 'unique' },
              ]
            },
            {
              key: 'age',
              type: 'number',
              label: 'Age',
            },
            {
              key: 'employmentStatus',
              type: 'boolean',
              label: 'Currently employed?',
            },
            {
              key: 'birthYear',
              type: 'enum',
              label: 'Birth Year',
              config: {
                options: [
                  { value: '1999', label: '1999' },
                  { value: '2000', label: '2000' },
                  // more here
                ]
              }
            }
          ],
        }
        const flatfileOptions = {
            publishableKey,
            environmentId,
            sheet,
            onRecordHook: (record) => {
                const name = record.get('name')
                if (name) {
                  record.set('name', name.toUpperCase())
                  record.addInfo('name', 'We updated the values to all uppercase')
                }
                return record
              },
            // more to come here in the following sections
        }
        window.FlatFileJavaScript.startFlatfile(flatfileOptions)
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>We are going to import your data now. Click the button below to start your import</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <button
          id="flatfileButton"
          onclick="openFlatfile({ publishableKey: 'YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY', environmentId: 'YOUR_ENV_ID'})"
      >
        Import Contacts
      </button>
    </div>
    <br>
  </body>
</html>
```
</CodeGroup>

## Getting Your Data

Flatfile has many different ways to handle and process data back to you once an import has happened, but the easiest in this context is the built-in `onSubmit` callback where the data is provided to you.

This `onSubmit` callback passes in an object that has the records for you to send wherever you might need to store them. For example purposes, we are going to simply log the results, but this is where you could send results to your server or pass them back to your application.

When the data is finished and available, the `onSubmit` method will provide you with a `sheet` that you can use the built-in methods like `allData()`, `validData()`, `errorData()`, `inChunks()` and `stream()` to get your data. Here’s a quick reference table for the available methods and what they do.

| Method                              | Example Usage                                                                   | Return description                                                                                                      | Additional notes                                                                                                                                       |

| `allData()`                         | `sheet.allData()`                                                               | This returns all the data that is being imported.                                                                       | All of the data does come with a way of determining whether the individual record was valid or not, but it returns all records regardless of validity. |
| `validData()`                       | `sheet.validData() `                                                            | This returns all records that pass are flagged as being valid and leaves off all invalid records.                       |                                                                                                                                                        |
| `errorData()`                       | `sheet.errorData()`                                                             | This will return only those records that are considered invalid and leaves off any valid records.                       |                                                                                                                                                        |
| `inChunks(cb, {chunkSize: number})` | `sheet.inChunks((data) => // do something with each chunk, { chunkSize: 100 })` | The inChunks method will run the callback function provided on each chunk of data until all chunks have been processed. | The default chunk size is 1000                                                                                                                         |
| `stream(cb)`                        | `sheet.stream((data) => // do something to each chunk of the stream)`           | The stream method will run the callback on every 1000 records available until all records have been processed           |                                                                                                                                                        |

With all those methods brought to light, let’s simply use the `allData` method to get all the records at once and then console log them in the process.

<CodeGroup>
```js index.html
// just working within the confines of the flatfileOptions object
const flatfileOptions = {
  publishableKey,
  environmentId,
  sheet,
  onRecordHook: (record) => {
    const name = record.get('name')
    if (name) {
      record.set('name', name.toUpperCase())
      record.addInfo('name', 'We updated the values to all uppercase')
    }
    return record
  },
  onSubmit: async ({sheet}) => {
    const data = await sheet.allData()
    console.log(data)
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Now let’s put it all together in the full example:

The above example is a fully working example that only needs to have your publishable key and environment id changed out for it to work as expected.

As a quick reminder, this is just the baseline of what Flatfile is capable of doing. You can check out more resources in our [documentation here.](https://flatfile.com/docs/overview)
