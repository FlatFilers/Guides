## Choose your path

First, decide if you want to start from scratch or work backwards from an existing project. Then, you'll encounter the choice of creating a new Space for each initialization or reusing an existing Space.

### Start from an example project

_recommended_

Clone a full React example project in the Flatfile GitHub repository. Then follow the README.

    Clone the Flatfile Next.js tutorial here. This shows both creating a new
    Space and reusing an existing Space when Flatfile is opened.

### Start from scratch

These Guides will walk you through setting up an embedded Flatfile Space from beginning to end. When configuring embedded Flatfile, you'll encounter the choice of creating a new Space for each initialization or reusing an existing Space.

    **Most Common.** For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one
    session, create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits
    situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred.

    **Coming soon.** Choose this when users might need to wait or can't finish
    in one go. It's great for keeping work context and letting users continue
    where they left off until the task is done.
