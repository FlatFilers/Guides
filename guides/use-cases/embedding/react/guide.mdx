## Install the package

If you already have a project, install Embed React from the npm/yarn public registry.

<CodeGroup>

```npm npm
npm install @flatfile/react@latest
# expects "16.0.0" or greater
```

```yarn yarn
yarn add @flatfile/react@latest
# expects "16.0.0" or greater
```

</CodeGroup>

## Choose your path

First, decide if you want to start from scratch or work backwards from an existing project. Then, you'll encounter the choice of creating a new Space for each initialization or reusing an existing Space.

### Start from scratch

These Guides will walk you through setting up an embedded Flatfile Space from beginning to end. When configuring embedded Flatfile, you'll encounter the choice of creating a new Space for each initialization or reusing an existing Space.

    **Most Common** For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one
    session, create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits
    situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred.

    **Coming soon** Choose this when users might need to wait or can't finish in
    one go. It's great for keeping work context and letting users continue where
    they left off until the task is done.
