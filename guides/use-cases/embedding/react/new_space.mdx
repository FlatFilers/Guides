description: "Create a new Space every time Flatfile is opened."

---

For synchronous data import/exchange completed in one session, create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred.

## Before you begin

<Snippet file="shared/pk_needed.mdx" />

### Check for proper `guestAuthentication`

The Space that will be embedded here must have `guestAuthentication`
configured with `shared_link` as an option. This is inherited from
the Environment when creating a new Space. [Learn
more](../../../../developer-tools/environment#guest-authentication).

## 1. Review your package.json

Make sure you have the `@flatfile/react` packages at minimum in your package.json. You can also copy this exactly and use `create-react-app` as a starting point if you want to start from a fresh repo.

```json package.json
{
  "name": "flatfile-react-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@flatfile/api": "^1.5.24",
    "@flatfile/listener": "0.3.15",
    "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook": "^1.1.0",
    "@flatfile/react": "^7.2.19",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": ["react-app", "react-app/jest"]
  },
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [">0.2%", "not dead", "not op_mini all"],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 2. Review or create file structure

Setup your app to look something like this:

```
- public
  |__ index.html
  |__ style.css

- src
  |__ App.tsx
  |__ index.tsx

  |__ package.json
  |__ package-lock.json
  |__ tsconfig.json

- package.json
```

In this file structure, your app should have two main directories, `public` and `src.`

The `public` directory contains the "index.html" file, which is the entry point of the application's front-end, and the "style.css" file for styling the iframe.

The `src` directory contains the main components and logic of the application, including the "App.tsx" file, which represents the root component, the "index.tsx" file, which is the entry point of your application's code, and optionally, the "config.ts" file for creating your Workbook client-side, and the "listener.ts" file, which handles your specific functionality related to listening to events client-side.

## 3. Add a Flatfile button and start your client

1. Add a button to your application to open Flatfile in a modal. Pass in your `publishableKey` and a new Space will be created on each page load.
2. Next, start your front end by heading to terminal and `npm start`
3. To see that it’s running, visit: https://localhost:1234 and you should see your page and a button.

```typescript src/App.tsx
import React, { Dispatch, SetStateAction, useState } from "react";
import { ISpace, useSpace } from "@flatfile/react";

const spaceProps: ISpace = {
  name: "Embedded Space",
  publishableKey: "",
  environmentId: "",
};

const Space = ({
  setShowSpace,
}: {
  setShowSpace: Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>;
}) => {
  const space = useSpace({
    ...spaceProps,
    closeSpace: {
      operation: "contacts:submit",
      onClose: () => setShowSpace(false),
    },
  });
  return space;
};

export default function App() {
  const [showSpace, setShowSpace] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: "16px" }}>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setShowSpace(!showSpace);
        }}
      >
        {showSpace === true ? "Close" : "Open"} space
      </button>
      {showSpace && <Space setShowSpace={setShowSpace} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```typescript src/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root")!;

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  rootElement
);
```

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.

## 4. Start your event listener

When the “Open Flatfile” button is clicked on your platform, it triggers a job event within the Space domain that initiates a configure operation. This operation is analogous to performing a POST request to the endpoint /api/v1/spaces with the parameter autoconfigure set to true.

In this step, we'll kickstart an event listener where you'll listen for that job and configure your Space on the fly.

Follow [this guide](../../../../guides/dynamic-configurations) to dynamically configure a new Space to your liking.

<Info>
  Coming soon: If you don't want to do this part yet, you can also reuse a demo
  Space and simply pass that info in.
