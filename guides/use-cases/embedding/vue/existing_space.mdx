For applications meant to use the same space consistently, open an existing space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where consistently editing a dataset is preferred.

## Before you begin

mkdir example-flatfile-vuejs-embed
```

Go into that directory.

```bash
cd example-flatfile-vuejs-embed
```

Follow prompts from the `init` command.

```bash
npm init
```
