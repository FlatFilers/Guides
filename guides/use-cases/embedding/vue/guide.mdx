## Quickstart

### Create a new Space

In this Guide, we'll create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred and is the easiest way to get started with Flatfile.

#### Choose your path

First, decide if you want to start from scratch or make changes to an existing project. Most developers find it easier to clone and start from a working example.
