Flatfile can support the simplest of workflows to the most nuanced & complex with Dynamic Spaces.

## Use cases

The use cases for dynamic configuration are endless, here are just a few ideas:

- Perhaps the user who is creating the Space informs how you want that Space to look for them
- Or maybe someone's location defines a different type of currency in your Sheet configuration
- Or say you need data from an external API in a precise moment in time to determine how you want your Workbook to look

Continue reading to learn how to configure a Space from scratch, and update it as things change.

## Configuring a new Space

### From the dashboard

When the "Create New Space" button is clicked on the platform, it triggers a [job `event`](../concepts/events) within the **space** `domain` that initiates a **configure** `operation`. This operation is analogous to performing a POST request to the endpoint [/api/v1/spaces](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/25e20c8ab61c5-create-a-space) with the parameter `autoconfigure` set to true.

1. Filter on the `domain` (space) and the `operation` (configure).
2. Listen for a [`job:ready`](../concepts/events#job-ready event).
3. Build your Space, at minimum including one Workbook.
4. Complete the job.
5. Optionally, listen for new events that are spawned from within your `space:configure` job.

#### Usage

In the following example, we build a Workbook and our getting started guide.
You can also follow along in the [flatfile-docs-kitchen-sink](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-docs-kitchen-sink/blob/main/javascript/dynamic-configurations/index.js) Github sandbox.

<Tip>
  Be sure to complete the job when it's complete. This tells the platform that
  you're finished and ready to display the Space to the end user.

### From an embedded button

When embedding Flatfile in your application, two things can happen:

1. A new Space is created every time the Flatfile platform is called to open
2. Or an existing Space can be passed in.

Listeners can be set up either server-side (use this Guide) and/or client-side within the embedded wrapper SDK.

Learn more about this [use case](../use-cases/embedding).

### Automatically

New Spaces can be created automatically by setting up headless flows.

Learn more about this [use case](../use-cases/headless).

## Updating a Space in place

As things are changing in a Space, sometimes you may want to adjust the configuration of your Space.
You can do this by listening for events that take place, and performing work as a result.

Continue reading for a few common examples.

### After an action is fired

When a button is clicked in the user interface, this creates a job.
You are already listening for this job to respond and do the work of that Action;
however, you may also want to adjust some of your configuration at the same time, too.

#### Usage

In the following example, we lock down access to the original Sheet
and update our getting started guide to reflect the change.

<Snippet file="guides/dynamic-configurations/block2.mdx" />

### After data changes

As the Sheet is being updated with data, perhaps you want to change the configuration.
In the following example, we listed for a commit created to do just that.

#### Usage
