Flatfile can support the simplest of workflows to the most nuanced & complex with Dynamic Spaces.

## Use cases

The use cases for dynamic configuration are endless, here are just a few ideas:

- Perhaps the user who is creating the Space informs how you want that Space to look for them
- Or maybe someone's location defines a different type of currency in your Sheet configuration
- Or say you need data from an external API in a precise moment in time to determine how you want your Workbook to look

Continue reading to learn how to configure a space from scratch, and update it as things change.


## Configuring a new Space

### From the dashboard

When the **Create New Space** button is clicked in the platform, this spawns a `configure` operation in the `space` domain. This is the equivalent of making a POST operation to `/api/v1/spaces` with `autoconfigure: true`.


1. Filter on the `domain` (space) and the `operation` (configure). 
2. Listen for a `job:ready` event.
3. Build your Space, at minimum including one Workbook.
4. Complete the job.
5. Optionally, listen for new events that are spawned inside your `space:configure` job. 


#### Usage

In the following example, we build a Workbook and our getting started guide. 
You can also follow along in this [Replit](https://replit.com/@flatfile/configure-a-space#index.js) sandbox.

<Tip>
  Be sure to complete the job when it's complete. 
  This tells the platform that you're finished and ready to display the Space to the end user.

```jsx listener.js
listener.filter({ job: 'space:configure' }, (configure) => {
  listener.on('job:ready', async (event) => {

    const { spaceId, environmentId, jobId } = event.context;

    await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
      info: 'Gettin started.',
      progress: 10
    });

    await api.workbooks.create({
      spaceId: spaceId,
      environmentId: environmentId,
      name: 'All Data',
      labels: ['primary'],
      sheets: [
        {
          name: 'Contacts',
          slug: 'contacts',
          fields: [
            {
              key: 'firstName',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'First Name',
            },
            {
              key: 'lastName',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Last Name',
            },
            {
              key: 'email',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Email',
            },
          ],
          actions: [
            {
              operation: 'duplicate',
              mode: 'background',
              label: 'Duplicate Sheet',
              type: 'string',
              description: 'Duplicate this Sheet and lock down the original.',
              primary: true,
            }
          ],
        },
      ],
      actions: [
        {
          operation: 'submitActionFg',
          mode: 'foreground',
          label: 'Submit foreground',
          type: 'string',
          description: 'Submit data to webhook.site',
          primary: true,
        },
      ],
    });

    await api.documents.create(spaceId, {
      title: "Getting Started",
      body:
        "# Welcome\n" +
        "### Say hello to your first customer Space in the new Flatfile!\n" +
        "Let's begin by first getting acquainted with what you're seeing in your Space initially.\n" +
        "---\n"
    });

    await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message: "This job is now complete."
      }
    });

  })
})
```

### From an embedded button

When embedding Flatfile in your application, a new Space is created every time 
the Flatfile platform is called to open.

Learn more about this [core path](../core-paths/embedding). 

### Automatically

New Spaces can be created automatically by setting up headless flows.

## Updating a Space in place

As things are changing in a Space, sometimes you may want to adjust the configuration of your Space.
You can do this by listening for events that take place, and performing work as a result.

Continue reading for a few common examples.

### After an action is fired

When a button is clicked in the user interface, this creates a job. 
You are already listening for this job to respond and do the work of that action; 
however, you may also want to adjust some of your configuration at the same time, too.

#### Usage

In the following example, we lock down access to the original Sheet 
and update our getting started guide to reflect the change.

```jsx listener.js
listener.filter({ job: 'sheet:duplicate' }, (configure) => {
  listener.on('job:ready', async (event) => {

    const { spaceId, environmentId, jobId, sheetId, workbookId } = event.context;

    await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {
      info: 'Gettin started.',
      progress: 10
    });

    //lock down the original Sheet
    await api.sheets.update(sheetId, {
      access: []
    })

    //update your Getting Started document
    await api.documents.update(documentId, {
      body:
        "update something here"
    });

    await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {
      outcome: {
        message: "This job is now complete."
      }
    });
  })
})
```

### After data changes

As the Sheet is being updated with data, perhaps you want to change the configuration. 
In the following example, we listed for a commit created to do just that.

#### Usage

```jsx listener.js
listener.filter({ sheet: 'SheetName' }, (configure) => {
  listener.on('commit:created', async (event) => {

    //make changes after cells in a Sheet have been updated

  })
})
```
