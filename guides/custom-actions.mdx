An action is a code-based operation that runs where that action is mounted. Actions run when a user clicks the corresponding user prompt in Flatfile.

Custom Actions are configured within a <Tooltip tip="A Data Definition Language...">[Blueprint](../concepts/workbooks#blueprint-object)</Tooltip>. 
The executable code within an Action is compiled into a <Tooltip tip="Large asynchronous work...">[Job](../concepts/jobs)</Tooltip> and can run asyncronously or immediately.

## Overview

Once a user has extracted and mapped data into a <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](../concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip>, it may be more efficient to run an operation on the entire dataset rather than making atomic transformations at the record- or field-level. For example:
* Sending a webhook that notifies your API of the data's readiness
* Populating a Sheet with data from another source
* Adding two different fields together after a user review's initial validation checks
* Moving valid data from an editable Sheet to a read-only Sheet

## Workbook-mounted

Workbook-mounted custom actions are represented as buttons in the top right of the Workbook.

### Usage
<Info>
  If you configure `primary: true` on a custom action, it will be represented as the rightmost button in the Workbook.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>

```jsx workbook.js
actions: [
  {
    "slug": "string",
    "label": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "primary": true,
  }
  {...}
]
```

```jsx listener.js
listener.on('action:triggered', async (event) => {
     //perform the action here
  })
```
</CodeGroup>

## Sheet-mounted

<Info>Each Sheet has built-in Actions.</Info>

Sheet-mounted custom actions are represented as a dropdown in the toolbar of the Sheet. In addition, you can attach a custom action to a Sheet.
