<Tip>
  Workbooks can function as a module within other Apps, and soon, they will also
  be available for standalone use. We're close to launching Standalone
  Workbooks, offering more flexibility and options.

  upcoming features and capabilities.

## Overview

Workbooks are analogous to a database, and like a database, they are configured
with a type-strict schema. A Workbook replaces the spreadsheet template you may
share with your users today when requesting data during the data collection
phase of customer onboarding or other file-based data exchange processes. Unlike
a spreadsheet, it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct,
and import data with real-time feedback.

With Workbooks, you can:

1. Accept data from many file types beyond CSVs. (And you can write your own
   file extractors if you can't find a plugin.)
2. Automatically apply any validation rules a developer has previously defined.
3. Provide end users the ability to add, remove, review, filter, and correct any
   data imported into a Workbook.
4. Define, in code, at least one primary Action that submits the reviewed data
   to a destination API, database, or workflow step of your choosing.

## Anatomy

A Workbook is comprised of one or more

<Tooltip tip="A collection of fields...">
  [Sheets](/documentation/blueprint/field-types)
</Tooltip>
plus any actions you want to take on those Sheets.

### Reference

[See API Reference](https://reference.flatfile.com/api-reference/workbooks/create-a-workbook)

#### `Sheets` _array_

A schema contains Sheets. Like tables in a database or sheets in a spreadsheet,
Sheets isolate different data schemas.

#### `Fields` _array_

Sheets contain

<Tooltip tip="Describes an attribute of the entity...">
  [Fields](/documentation/blueprint/field-types)
</Tooltip>
. Fields are defined properties of your schema (eg a first_name on a contact
sheet.)

#### `Actions` _array_

Workbooks and Sheets can also contain Actions. Actions are developer-defined
operations or macros invoked by end users on selected data like Submit to API,
Download as PDF.

[Learn more about Actions](/learning-center/concepts/actions)

#### `Settings` _object_

`trackChanges: true`: Disables actions on Sheet and Workbook when there is a
commit that has not been completed (often when Hooks are running)

`noMappingRedirect: true`: When the user drags a file into a Sheet in this
Workbook, usually the user is redirected to the Mapping step. This setting
prevents that redirect. This is especially useful when you are using the
[automap plugin](/learning-center/guides/automap).

#### `Labels` _array_

To have a workbook appear first in the sidebar, give it the label `pinned` (it
will even have a pin icon!). You can also add other custom labels to your
workbooks as needed.
