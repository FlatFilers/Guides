The relationship defines a reference to another Sheet, similar to a Foreign Key.
Links should be established automatically by the mapping engine (the logic that
creates a mapping plan automatically when a user maps their data into a workbook)
or similar upon an evaluation of unique or similar columns between datasets.

## Configuration Options

- **ref** - Full path reference to another Sheet/table configuration. Must be in
the same Workbook
- **relationship** - The type of relationship this defines. Currently, only
`has-one` is supported

## Usage

### Inheritance

This example introduces two fields linked by a relationship, inheriting the
respective email addresses of the father and mother from another Sheet.

```json workbooks.create
// in the context of create Workbook API call
  {
    "fields": [
      {
        "key": "father",
        "type": "reference",
        "config": {
          "ref": "parents",
          "key": "email",
          "relationship": "has-one"
        }
      },
      {
        "key": "mother",
        "type": "reference",
        "config": {
          "ref": "parents",
          "key": "email",
          "relationship": "has-one"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```


### Lookups

This example mimics a vlookup operation by fetching a value from a linked record
and applying it to a designated field in the original record.

The linked record is designated by a reference field in the original record, and
the sought-after value is defined by a lookup field in the linked record.

When a lookup value is located, it's placed into the original record's target
field. Furthermore, a message is added to the record, detailing the origin of
the retrieved value.

<ParamField path="record" type="Object">
  The record to perform the vlookup on.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="referenceFieldKey" type="string">
  The name of the reference field on the original record that links to the
  linked record.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="lookupFieldKey" type="string">
  The name of the field on the linked record that contains the value to be
  looked up.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="targetFieldKey" type="string">
  The name of the field on the original record that the lookup value should be
  set to.
</ParamField>

```jsx
// in the context of listener.use(recordHook){}
  export const vlookup = (
    record,
    referenceFieldKey,
    lookupFieldKey,
    targetFieldKey
  ) => {
    console.log("Initial Record: " + JSON.stringify(record));
    const links = record.getLinks(referenceFieldKey);
    console.log("Linked Record: " + JSON.stringify(links));
    const lookupValue = links?.[0]?.[lookupFieldKey];
    console.log(
      "Reference Fields Key: " +
        referenceFieldKey +
        " : " +
        "LookUpValue: " +
        lookupValue
    );

    if (isNotNil(lookupValue)) {
      record.set(targetFieldKey, lookupValue);
      record.addInfo(
        targetFieldKey,
        `${targetFieldKey} set based on ${referenceFieldKey}.`
      );
    }
  };
```
