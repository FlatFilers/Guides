# Cron Events

Cron events in Flatfile are scheduled events that occur at specified intervals, enabling automated, time-based operations within the platform. These events follow the standard cron syntax for scheduling and are particularly useful for automating recurring tasks.

## Understanding Cron Events

Cron events are system-generated events that trigger based on a defined schedule. They follow the same event structure as other Flatfile events but are initiated by the system's scheduling mechanism rather than user actions.

A cron event includes:
- Event type: `cron:triggered`
- Schedule information in the payload
- Context about the environment and space where it was triggered

## Cron Syntax

Flatfile uses standard cron syntax for scheduling events:

```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─ day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)
│ │ │ └─── month (1 - 12)
│ │ └───── day of month (1 - 31)
│ └─────── hour (0 - 23)
└───────── minute (0 - 59)
```

Common patterns:
- `* * * * *` - Every minute
- `0 * * * *` - Every hour
- `0 0 * * *` - Every day at midnight
- `0 0 * * 0` - Every Sunday at midnight
- `0 0 1 * *` - First day of every month at midnight

## Implementing Cron Events

Cron events are handled through listeners like other Flatfile events. Here's a basic implementation:

```typescript
import { Listener } from "@flatfile/listener";

export default (listener: Listener) => {
  listener.on("cron:triggered", async (event) => {
    // Handle the cron event
    console.log("Cron event triggered:", event.payload.schedule);
    
    // Implement your scheduled task logic here
    // For example, cleaning up old data:
    const api = event.api;
    try {
      // Get spaces older than 30 days
      const oldSpaces = await api.spaces.list({
        filter: {
          createdAt: {
            lt: new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
          }
        }
      });
      
      // Archive old spaces
      for (const space of oldSpaces.data) {
        await api.spaces.update(space.id, {
          archived: true
        });
      }
      
      console.log("Successfully archived old spaces");
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in cron job:", error);
    }
  });
};
```

## Common Use Cases

Cron events are particularly useful for:

1. Data Cleanup
   - Archiving old spaces
   - Removing expired files
   - Cleaning up temporary data

2. Scheduled Updates
   - Refreshing cached data
   - Updating reference data
   - Syncing external systems

3. Automated Reporting
   - Generating usage reports
   - Monitoring system health
   - Tracking data quality metrics

4. Maintenance Tasks
   - Database optimization
   - Log rotation
   - System checks

## Best Practices

When working with cron events:

1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error handling
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Consider retry mechanisms for failed tasks

2. **Performance**
   - Keep tasks lightweight
   - Avoid long-running operations
   - Consider using batch processing for large datasets

3. **Monitoring**
   - Log important operations
   - Track task completion
   - Monitor execution time

4. **Testing**
   - Test cron jobs in development environment
   - Verify timing accuracy
   - Validate error handling

## Example: Scheduled Data Export

Here's an example of using cron events to automatically export data on a schedule:

```typescript
import { Listener } from "@flatfile/listener";
import { FlatfileClient } from "@flatfile/api";

export default (listener: Listener) => {
  listener.on("cron:triggered", { schedule: "0 0 * * *" }, async (event) => {
    // This will run daily at midnight
    
    const api = event.api;
    try {
      // Get all workbooks
      const workbooks = await api.workbooks.list();
      
      for (const workbook of workbooks.data) {
        // Create an export job for each workbook
        await api.jobs.create({
          type: "workbook:export",
          operation: "export",
          source: workbook.id,
          config: {
            format: "csv",
            includeMetadata: true
          }
        });
      }
      
      console.log("Successfully scheduled exports for all workbooks");
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error scheduling exports:", error);
    }
  });
};
```

## Limitations and Considerations

When implementing cron events, keep in mind:

1. **Timing Accuracy**
   - Events may not trigger exactly on schedule
   - Plan for slight delays in execution
   - Don't rely on precise timing for critical operations

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Consider system load during peak times
   - Avoid scheduling resource-intensive tasks during high-traffic periods
   - Monitor resource consumption

3. **Concurrency**
   - Handle multiple concurrent cron events appropriately
   - Implement locking mechanisms if needed
   - Consider using job queues for task management

4. **Environment Specifics**
   - Test cron jobs in development environment
   - Be aware of timezone differences
   - Consider environment-specific scheduling needs
