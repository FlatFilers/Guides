Flatfile's AI Assist enables you to transform and clean your data quickly and effectively using natural language commands. This no code approach allows you to easily transform your data in two simple steps:

1. Start by selecting the data you want to transform within the Flatfile platform.
2. Use AI Assist to describe the transformations you need, and watch as your data is instantly updated.

## AI Assist Capabilities

### Combine Data

Combine data from multiple columns into a single value. For instance, use first name, last name, and domain name to create an email address.

Using AI Assist to create email addresses from names and domain:


```plaintext
  Combine first name, last name, and domain name to create email addresses.
```

### Calculate Values

Generate new values by performing calculations on existing data. For example, multiply property value by tax rate to calculate property taxes.

Using AI Assist to calculate property taxes:

```plaintext
  Multiply property value by tax rate to calculate property taxes.
```


### Extract Data

Extract specific parts of a string to create new columns. For example, divide a full name field into first, middle, and last names.

Using AI Assist to split full names:


```plaintext
  Split full name into first name, middle name, and last name.
```


### Move and Modify Data

Move data from one column to another, change data formatting, delete values, and more.

Using AI Assist to reformat dates:

```plaintext
  Change date format from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD.
```


### Language Support

Ask AI Assist to transform your data in multiple languages.

Using AI Assist in your lanaguage of choice:

```plaintext
  Changez le format de date de MM/JJ/AAAA à AAAA-MM-JJ.
```


## AI Assist Features

AI Assist in data transformations offers a powerful suite of features designed to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and security of your data workflows. By leveraging intelligent filtering, prompt suggestions, preview capabilities, iterative updates, version history, and robust data privacy measures, AI Assist ensures that your data transformations are both precise and protected. 
This guide will explore each of these features in detail, demonstrating how they can help you achieve optimal results in your data management tasks.

### Filter & Prompt
##### Use flexible filtering tools to narrow down your dataset before applying transformations.

Filter your data and apply AI Assist commands to only the selected records.
This feature allows you to target specific subsets of your data, ensuring that the AI-driven transformations are applied precisely where needed.
By selecting only the relevant records, you can streamline the transformation process, reduce errors, and enhance the overall efficiency of your data workflows. This targeted approach also helps in maintaining the integrity of your data, as only the necessary parts are altered while the rest remain untouched.

### Prompt Ideas and Tips
##### Get suggestions for prompts and tips to achieve the best results. 

Get suggestions for prompts and tips to achieve the best results. 
AI Assist provides intelligent recommendations for crafting effective prompts, helping users to articulate their data transformation needs clearly. 
These suggestions are tailored based on the context of your data and the desired outcome, ensuring that you can leverage the full potential of AI-driven transformations. 
With these guided prompts and tips, even users with limited experience can achieve professional-level results, making the tool accessible and easy to use.

### Preview Changes
##### See how your data will change based on your prompt before committing to the transformation.

Preview the changes AI Assist will make before applying them to ensure accuracy. 
This feature allows you to see a detailed overview of how your data will be transformed before any changes are committed.
By previewing these modifications, you can verify that the transformations align with your expectations and requirements.
This step acts as a safeguard against potential errors, providing you with the confidence that the AI-driven changes will enhance your data quality without introducing unforeseen issues.

### Iterative Prompting
##### Make adjustments to your prompts and see the updated results in real-time.

Refine your prompts and see instant updates to your data in the preview mode. 
Iterative prompting enables a dynamic interaction with your data transformation process, allowing you to make adjustments and see the results in real time. 
This continuous feedback loop helps in fine-tuning the prompts to achieve the desired outcomes more accurately. 
By iterating on your prompts, you can progressively improve the transformation process, ensuring that the final results meet your exact specifications.

### Version History
##### Restore your data to any previous state with ease.

Keep a snapshot of your data before each change, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
Version history is a crucial feature that provides a safety net for your data transformations.
By maintaining a record of each state of your data, you can easily backtrack to any previous version if the current changes do not yield the expected results.
This capability ensures that your data is always recoverable, giving you peace of mind and flexibility in managing your transformations.


### Data Privacy
##### Your data is not shared with third-party AI providers.

AI Assist ensures your data remains secure and private, with all processing done within Flatfile’s infrastructure.
Data privacy is a paramount concern, and AI Assist addresses this by guaranteeing that all data processing occurs within a secure and controlled environment.
By keeping all operations within Flatfile’s infrastructure, the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access is minimized.
This commitment to privacy ensures that your data remains confidential and protected throughout the transformation process.
