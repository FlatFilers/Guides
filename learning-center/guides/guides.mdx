Flatfile's Guide system enables you to create and manage contextual help content within your data import experience. The system consists of two main components: Guides (content) and Guidance (display configuration). This separation allows for flexible, targeted help delivery that adapts to different user roles and contexts.

When you implement guides in your space, the system manages content delivery based on user interactions and predetermined triggers, ensuring users receive help exactly when they need it.

## Understanding the Guide Architecture

Guides are **environment-level resources** that contain the actual help content. Guidance configurations are **space-level resources** that determine how and when those guides are displayed. This architecture offers several key benefits:

- **Centralized content management**: Update a guide once at the environment level, and the changes propagate to all spaces using that guide
- **Consistent messaging**: Maintain uniform help content across multiple spaces
- **Efficient maintenance**: No need to update the same content in multiple spaces

Guides and guidance are coupled by a unique slug, creating a one-to-many relationship where a single guide can be displayed in multiple spaces with different presentation settings.

## Creating Guides

Guides are content blocks that contain help text, instructions, or documentation. Each guide is versioned and can contain multiple content blocks.

### Guide Structure

A guide consists of a metadata section and content blocks:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Structure
interface Guide {
  slug: string;         // Unique identifier
  title: string;        // Display title
  description: string;  // Brief description
  blocks: Block[];      // Content blocks
  metadata: Record<string, any>;  // Additional metadata
}

interface Block {
  type: "markdown";     // Currently only markdown is supported
  content: string;      // Actual content
}
```

**Note:** Currently, only markdown is supported as a block type, with additional types planned for future releases.

```typescript Example
{
  "slug": "data-import-guide",
  "title": "Data Import Guide",
  "description": "Learn how to import your data",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "# Getting Started\nFollow these steps..."
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "lastUpdated": "2024-02-20"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
   Guide slugs must be unique within your environment and cannot be changed after creation.
   Choose them carefully as they serve as permanent identifiers that connect guides to guidance configurations.
</Warning>

### Creating via API

1. Obtain your Secret Key from the [API Keys](https://platform.flatfile.com/dashboard/keys-and-secrets) page.
2. Make an authenticated request to create a guide:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -X POST https://api.x.flatfile.com/v1/environments/{{flatfile_environment_id}}/guides \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_123" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
     "slug": "data-import-guide",
     "title": "Data Import Guide",
     "description": "Learn how to import your data",
     "blocks": [
       {
         "type": "markdown",
         "content": "# Getting Started\nFollow these steps..."
       }
     ]
   }'
```

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "id": "guide_123",
    "slug": "data-import-guide",
    "title": "Data Import Guide",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Configuring Guidance

Guidance determines how and when guides are presented to users. It includes display type, trigger conditions, and targeting rules. Each guidance configuration lives at the space level and references a guide by its slug.

### Display Types

Flatfile offers three display types for guides, each suited to different content lengths and use cases:

1. **Tooltip**
   - Lightweight popups that appear on hover
   - Best for quick tips and short explanations (1-2 lines)
   - Automatically positioned relative to target
   ```typescript
   {
     type: "tooltip",
     target: "workbook:primary_action",
     trigger: "hover"
   }
   ```

2. **Sidebar**
   - Full-height panel on the right side
   - Ideal for detailed documentation with multiple sections
   - Perfect for step-by-step instructions
   ```typescript
   {
     type: "sidebar",
     target: "sheet:manage_columns",
     trigger: "manual"
   }
   ```

3. **Popout**
   - Modal-style window in center of screen
   - Good for medium-length content (2-3 sentences)
   - Can include rich media
   ```typescript
   {
     type: "popout",
     target: "workbook:job_panel",
     trigger: "first"
   }
   ```

<Note>
   Choose your display type based on content length and importance.
   Tooltips work best for simple hints, while sidebars are better for comprehensive documentation.
</Note>

### Target Locations

Guides can be attached to specific UI elements using static or dynamic targets:

#### Static Targets
Pre-defined locations in the UI:

```typescript
type StaticTarget =
  | "workbook:primary_action"
  | "workbook:secondary_action"
  | "workbook:job_panel"
  | "workbook:version_panel"
  | "workbook:data_clips"
  | "sidebar:files_tab"
  | "sidebar:secrets_tab"
  | "sidebar:guests_tab"
  | "sidebar:documents_tab"
  | "sidebar:workbooks_tab"
  | "sheet:manage_columns"
  | "sheet:search"
  | "sheet:valid_filters"
  | "sheet:filter_by_error"
  | "sheet:data_clips"
  | "sheet:ai_transform"
  | "sheet:download"
  | "sheet:delete"
```

#### Dynamic Targets
Generated targets for specific instances:

```typescript
type DynamicTarget = 
  | `dynamic:sheet:${string}`
  | `dynamic:document:${string}`
  | `dynamic:workbook:sheet:${string}`
  | `dynamic:sheet:action:${string}`
```

### Trigger Types

Guides can be triggered in three ways:

- **First**: Displays the first time a user accesses the space
- **Hover**: Appears when the user hovers over the target element
- **Manual**: Triggered by a specific user action or click

### Role-Based Display

Configure different guidance for different user roles to ensure users only see guidance relevant to their permissions:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Configuration
interface GuidanceOptions {
  role?: "admin" | "guest";
  target: StaticTarget | DynamicTarget;
  type: "tooltip" | "sidebar" | "popout";
  trigger: "hover" | "first" | "manual";
}
```

```typescript Example
{
  "role": "admin",
  "target": "sidebar:secrets_tab",
  "type": "sidebar",
  "trigger": "first"
}
```
</CodeGroup>


### Creating Guidance via API

To create guidance using the API, follow these steps:

1. Obtain your Secret Key from the [API Keys](https://platform.flatfile.com/dashboard/keys-and-secrets) page.
2. Make an authenticated request to create guidance at the space level:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -X POST {{flatfile_base_url}}/v1/spaces/{{flatfile_space_id}}/guidance \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_123" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
     "guideSlug": "data-import-guide",  // References the environment-level guide
     "target": "workbook:primary_action",
     "type": "popout",
     "trigger": "first",
     "role": "admin"
   }'
```

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "id": "guidance_456",
    "guideSlug": "data-import-guide",
    "target": "workbook:primary_action",
    "type": "popout",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>


## Implementation Examples

### 1. Onboarding Guide

Create a guide for new users:

```typescript
// First, create the guide at the environment level
const onboardingGuide = {
  slug: "getting-started",
  title: "Welcome to Flatfile",
  description: "Learn the basics of data importing",
  blocks: [
    {
      type: "markdown",
      content: "# Welcome!\nLet's walk through the key features..."
    }
  ]
};

// Then, create guidance configurations for each space that should use this guide
const onboardingGuidance = {
  guideSlug: "getting-started",
  target: "workbook:primary_action",
  type: "popout",
  trigger: "first"
};
```

### 2. Feature Tour

Create a sequence of guides for a feature tour:

```typescript
// Create guides at the environment level
const featureTourGuides = [
  {
    slug: "upload-guide",
    title: "Uploading Files",
    blocks: [
      {
        type: "markdown",
        content: "# File Upload\nDrag and drop your files here..."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    slug: "mapping-guide",
    title: "Column Mapping",
    blocks: [
      {
        type: "markdown",
        content: "# Column Mapping\nMatch your columns to our template..."
      }
    ]
  }
];

// Create guidance for each space
const featureTourGuidance = [
  {
    guideSlug: "upload-guide",
    target: "sidebar:files_tab",
    type: "sidebar",
    trigger: "first"
  },
  {
    guideSlug: "mapping-guide",
    target: "sheet:manage_columns",
    type: "popout",
    trigger: "first"
  }
];
```

### 3. Role-Specific Documentation

Create different guides for different user roles:

```typescript
// Create a single guide at the environment level
const settingsGuide = {
  slug: "settings-guide",
  title: "Settings Guide",
  blocks: [
    {
      type: "markdown",
      content: "# Settings\nManage your configuration..."
    }
  ]
};

// Then create role-specific guidance at the space level
const adminGuidance = {
  guideSlug: "settings-guide",
  target: "sidebar:secrets_tab",
  type: "sidebar",
  trigger: "first",
  role: "admin"
};

const guestGuidance = {
  guideSlug: "settings-guide",
  target: "workbook:primary_action",
  type: "tooltip",
  trigger: "hover",
  role: "guest"
};
```

<Tip>
   For optimal user experience, consider implementing progressive disclosure - showing more complex guides only after users have mastered the basics.
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Guide Creation

When creating guides, follow these principles:

1. **Identify the right UI element**: Choose specific interface components that need explanation
2. **Consider user roles**: Determine which users (admins, guests, regular users) need to see each guide
3. **Select appropriate format**:
   - Tooltips for quick hints (1-2 lines)
   - Popouts for feature explanations (2-3 sentences)
   - Sidebars for detailed instructions (longer content with sections)
4. **Choose the right trigger**: Use "first" for onboarding, "hover" for discoverable tips, and "manual" for on-demand help

This ensures your guidance appears exactly where and when needed, for the right users, in the most appropriate format.

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Guide not appearing | Check that both guide (environment) and guidance (space) are correctly configured with matching slugs |
| Content not updating | Ensure guide is updated at the environment level |
| Display issues | Confirm content length suits chosen display type |
| Role-specific guides not showing | Verify user role permissions match guidance configuration |
