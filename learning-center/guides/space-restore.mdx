Flatfile's Space Restore feature allows you to restore a space to a previous point in time. This is particularly useful when you need to:
- Recover from unintended data changes
- Roll back problematic data transformations
- Return to a known good state

## How It Works

The restore process involves two steps:
1. First, you can preview what changes would be made by the restore operation
2. Then, you can execute the restore operation if the proposed changes look correct

## Viewing Restore Operations

To see what changes would be made when restoring a space to a specific point in time, use the following endpoint:



The `dateTime` parameter should be a valid ISO 8601 timestamp. The response will include a list of operations that would be performed to restore the space to that point in time.

## Executing the Restore

Once you've reviewed the proposed changes, you can execute the restore operation using:



This will restore the space to its state at the specified point in time. The operation affects various components within the space, including:
- Workbooks and their configurations
- Sheets and their data
- Documents
- Actions
- Other space-specific settings

## Best Practices

1. Always review the proposed changes using the GET endpoint before executing a restore
2. Choose a restore point that represents a known good state of your data
3. Consider creating a snapshot of the current state before performing a restore
4. Communicate with users who might be actively working in the space before initiating a restore

## Limitations

- You cannot restore to a point before the space was created
- The restore operation affects the entire space; you cannot selectively restore individual components
- Active jobs or operations in the space should be completed or canceled before performing a restore
