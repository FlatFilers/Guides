# Advanced Filters

Advanced Filters provide powerful capabilities for selecting, filtering, and taking actions on specific rows in your data sheets. When enabled, this feature allows you to select rows based on complex criteria and perform bulk operations like deletion and download on the selected data.

## Enabling Advanced Filters

Advanced Filters can be enabled through the `advancedFilters` feature flag in your environment. When enabled, users will have access to enhanced filtering capabilities and a row selection toolbar that appears when rows are selected.

```javascript
// Example of enabling advanced filters in your environment
const { features } = useContext(EnvironmentsContext);
const advancedFiltersEnabled = features?.advancedFilters;
```

## Row Selection Tools

When Advanced Filters are enabled and rows are selected, a selection toolbar appears at the bottom of the sheet. This toolbar provides:

1. A count of how many rows are currently selected
2. Action buttons for common operations on the selected rows

### Available Actions

The Row Selection Tools bar provides quick access to common actions for your selected rows:

#### Delete Selected Rows

The delete action allows you to remove all selected rows from your sheet. When clicked:

1. A confirmation modal appears to prevent accidental deletion
2. Upon confirmation, all selected rows are removed from the sheet
3. A toast notification confirms the successful deletion

#### Download Selected Rows

The download action exports only the selected rows to a CSV file. When clicked:

1. A modal appears with download options
2. Upon confirmation, a CSV file containing only the selected rows is generated
3. The file is automatically downloaded to your device

## Selection Methods

Advanced Filters support multiple ways to select rows:

1. **Individual Selection**: Click the checkbox at the beginning of a row to select it
2. **Range Selection**: Select a row, hold Shift, and select another row to select all rows in between
3. **Filter-Based Selection**: Apply filters and then select all filtered rows
4. **Select All**: Use the checkbox in the header to select all rows (or all filtered rows)

## Working with Selections

The selection state is maintained as you navigate through your data, allowing you to:

1. Select rows across multiple pages
2. Apply filters to narrow down your selection
3. See a running count of selected rows
4. Perform bulk actions on your selection

## Combining with Other Features

Advanced Filters work seamlessly with other Flatfile features:

- **Standard Filters**: Apply standard filters first, then select rows from the filtered results
- **Search**: Search for specific data, then select from the search results
- **Sorting**: Sort your data to identify patterns, then select relevant rows
- **Validation**: Select rows with errors to quickly identify and fix issues

## Best Practices

For the most effective use of Advanced Filters:

1. Use filters first to narrow down your dataset before making selections
2. Verify your selection count before performing bulk actions
3. For very large datasets, consider working with smaller filtered subsets
4. Use the download feature to analyze selected data in external tools

Advanced Filters provide a powerful way to work with specific subsets of your data, making it easier to clean, analyze, and transform your information efficiently.
