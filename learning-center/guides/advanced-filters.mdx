Advanced Filters provide a unified, query-based approach to filtering and searching data in Flatfile, replacing the legacy modal and popover interfaces with a consistent experience across all filtering operations.

## Overview

The Advanced Filters feature enhances the data filtering experience by:

1. Providing a consistent query-based interface for all filtering operations
2. Replacing separate modal and popover interfaces with a unified approach
3. Enabling more complex filtering capabilities through the query toolbar
4. Allowing users to save and reuse filter configurations as views

When enabled, column-specific filtering operations like "Filter by Value" and "Search in Field" will create or update queries in the toolbar rather than using separate UI components.

## How It Works

### Legacy Behavior (Without Advanced Filters)

In the legacy filtering system:

- **Search in Field** via column menu would:
  - Open a modal with a search input
  - Update the `searchValue` and `searchField` URL parameters when a value was entered

- **Filter by Value** via column menu would:
  - Show a popover menu for selecting values
  - Replace the `q` property in the URL parameters when selections were made

### New Behavior (With Advanced Filters)

With Advanced Filters enabled:

- **Search in Field** via column menu will:
  - Create a new query in the toolbar (or update an existing one) with an `ilike` operation
  - Set the query as active and focus it for immediate editing

- **Filter by Value** via column menu will:
  - Create a new query in the toolbar (or update an existing one) with an `eq` operation
  - Set the query as active and focus it for immediate editing

This approach ensures that all filtering operations use the same interface and underlying query mechanism, providing a more consistent user experience.

## Saved Views

Advanced Filters integrates with the Saved Views feature, allowing users to:

1. Create and save complex filter configurations
2. Share filtered views with other users
3. Quickly switch between different data perspectives
4. Manage views through a dedicated dropdown in the toolbar

## Enabling Advanced Filters

Advanced Filters can be enabled by setting the `advancedFilters` feature flag to `true` in your environment configuration.

### Using the API

```javascript
// Enable Advanced Filters via API
await api.environments.update(environmentId, {
  metadata: {
    features: {
      advancedFilters: true
    }
  }
});
```

### Using the Dashboard

1. Navigate to your environment settings in the Flatfile dashboard
2. Go to the Features section
3. Enable the "Advanced Filters" toggle

## Query Operations

Advanced Filters supports various query operations, including:

| Operation | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `eq` | Equals | `firstName eq "John"` |
| `ne` | Not equals | `firstName ne "John"` |
| `gt` | Greater than | `age gt 30` |
| `lt` | Less than | `age lt 30` |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal | `age gte 30` |
| `lte` | Less than or equal | `age lte 30` |
| `ilike` | Contains (case insensitive) | `firstName ilike "oh"` |
| `is error` | Has error status | `email is error` |
| `is valid` | Has valid status | `email is valid` |

## Best Practices

- Use Advanced Filters when you need consistent filtering behavior across your application
- Leverage Saved Views for frequently used filter configurations
- Combine multiple filters to create precise data views
- Use the query toolbar for complex filtering scenarios

## Limitations

- Some legacy filtering behaviors may not be fully replicated in the Advanced Filters interface
- Custom filtering implementations may need to be updated to work with the new query-based approach
