# Flatfile MCP Server

The Flatfile MCP Server creates a bridge between AI assistants and your Flatfile data, enabling powerful natural language interactions with your data management workflows.

## Features

The Flatfile MCP Server allows AI assistants like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and others to:

- Access and manage your Flatfile data using 100+ API endpoints
- View and manipulate Sheets, Workbooks, and Spaces
- Add, edit, and delete Records
- Ask questions about your data
- Generate new Sheets using natural language
- Create Workbooks from scratch
- And much more!

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need:

- A Flatfile account
- Either a Flatfile Personal Access Token or API Key
- An AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Setup Options

The Flatfile MCP Server can be integrated with various AI assistants. Below are setup instructions for the most common platforms.

### Filtering Tools

Flatfile provides over 100 API endpoints. To improve performance and focus, you can filter the tools to only include those you need:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-flatfile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@flatfile/mcp-server", "--enabled-tools", "getRecords,updateRecords"],
      "env": {
        "FLATFILE_BEARER_TOKEN": "pat_your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
For better performance and security, only enable the specific tools you need for your use case.

### Claude Desktop Setup

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-flatfile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@flatfile/mcp-server", "--enabled-tools", "getRecords,updateRecords"],
      "env": {
        "FLATFILE_BEARER_TOKEN": "pat_your_token_here",
        "FLATFILE_API_URL": "https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
The `FLATFILE_API_URL` parameter is optional and only needed for non-US regions or self-hosting.
</Info>

### Claude Code Setup

To configure Claude Code with the Flatfile MCP Server:

1. Open your terminal
2. Run the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add mcp-server-flatfile -e FLATFILE_API_URL=https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1 -e FLATFILE_BEARER_TOKEN=pat_your_token_here -- npx -y @flatfile/mcp-server --enabled-tools getRecords,updateRecords
```

3. Verify the installation by checking Claude Code's configuration

See [Claude Code MCP setup instructions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp) for more details.

### Cursor Setup

Add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-flatfile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@flatfile/mcp-server", "--enabled-tools", "getRecords,updateRecords"],
      "env": {
        "FLATFILE_BEARER_TOKEN": "pat_your_token_here",
        "FLATFILE_API_URL": "https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Use Cases

Here are some powerful ways to leverage AI assistants with Flatfile:

1. **Natural Language Data Queries**
   - Ask your AI assistant questions about your data like "Show me all customers who placed orders in the last month"

2. **Automated Data Analysis**
   - Request summaries, insights, and patterns in your data

3. **Data Transformation & Cleanup**
   - Use natural language to describe data transformations you want to apply

4. **Workflow Creation**
   - Create new Workbooks and Sheets based on verbal descriptions

5. **Data Validation**
   - Have your AI assistant validate data quality and suggest improvements

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Flatfile MCP Server:

- Verify your token credentials are correct and have not expired
- Ensure your MCP configuration file has the correct syntax
- Check that your enabled tools match your requirements
- Verify your AI assistant has the necessary permissions
