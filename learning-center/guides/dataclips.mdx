## Overview

DataClips allow users to extract, edit, and collaborate on a subset of data from a 
<Tooltip tip="A collection of fields...">[Sheet](../blueprint/overview#terms)</Tooltip> without 
affecting the original sheet. Once changes are finalized, they can be merged back into the main sheet, 
ensuring controlled updates while preserving the original dataset's integrity.

## How it works

### **Creating a DataClip**
Users can create a DataClip by selecting specific records from a sheet, allowing for focused edits without 
affecting live data. This is especially useful for sharing only the necessary data with collaborators, 
ensuring they can make updates independently of the main sheet. Multiple DataClips can be created from a 
single sheet, enabling different teams or individuals to work in parallel without interfering with each other’s workflows.

<Note>
  DataClips are currently not supported in pre-processing. This functionality is being considered for future updates.

### **Adding Records to a DataClip**
DataClips are flexible—users can continue refining them even after creation. Additional records can be added to an existing 
DataClip, allowing for evolving workflows where new data points become relevant. This ensures that the right information is 
included as needs change, without having to create a new clip from scratch.

### **Editing and Collaboration**
DataClips let users in a <Tooltip tip="A micro-application...">Space</Tooltip> edit records independently 
of the main sheet, ensuring the original data remains intact until changes are merged. The collaboration 
entitlement allows users to leave comments for discussion within a clip, making it easy to refine and 
finalize updates seamlessly. To enable collaboration, you can [connect with a product expert.](https://flatfile.com/contact-sales/consult/)

### **Marking Records for Deletion**
Users can flag records for deletion, which will remove the records from the main sheet once the changes 
are merged. These records remain visible in the DataClip with a strikethrough to indicate pending removal. 
If needed, users can easily revert a record that has been marked for deletion before merging via the restore functionality.


### **Merging Changes**
When merging, users are presented with a visual diff of all changes, allowing them to review and confirm updates 
before they are applied. If the same record has been modified in both the DataClip and the main sheet, a conflict 
resolution interface ensures that users can make an informed decision on which version to keep. The merge process 
enforces data integrity by preventing unresolved conflicts from being applied, ensuring that only finalized, 
accurate data is merged. Only the creator of a DataClip has the authority to merge changes back into the main sheet, 
maintaining control over the final updates.

### **DataClip Library**
The DataClip Library provides an organized way to find and manage DataClips. Users can search for DataClips by sheet ID, 
creator, or clip name, as well as filter by status, making it easy to locate specific clips. 

From the library, users can:
- Edit DataClip details, such as updating the name or description.
- Delete a DataClip when it’s no longer needed.

## Events and Triggers

The following new events are introduced for tracking DataClip activities:
- `data-clip:created` – Triggered when a new DataClip is created.
- `data-clip:updated` – Fired when a DataClip is modified (excluding individual cell edits).
- `data-clip:deleted` – Triggered when a DataClip is removed.

These events integrate seamlessly with existing event-driven workflows, allowing teams to monitor and react to DataClip actions efficiently.
