## Overview

Flatfile's Autobuild and Build Mode features provide powerful tools to configure your data import experience without writing code. These features allow you to:

- **Autobuild**: Automatically generate a data model from sample files or AI prompts
- **Build Mode**: Fine-tune your configuration with a visual interface
- **Build Mode Chat**: Get AI assistance to modify your configuration through natural language

These tools work together to streamline the process of creating and refining your data import experience, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## Autobuild

Autobuild is a feature that automatically generates a data model for your Flatfile space based on sample files or AI prompts. This is an excellent starting point for creating your data import experience.

### Starting Autobuild

You can initiate Autobuild from the dashboard or via the API.

#### From the Dashboard

1. Navigate to your application in the dashboard.
2. Select "Create from Template" or "Autobuild" option.
3. Choose one of the following input methods:
   - **Upload a sample file**: Provide a CSV, Excel, or other supported file format
   - **Enter field names**: Manually specify the fields you need
   - **Use AI prompt**: Describe your data model in natural language
   - **Start empty**: Begin with a blank configuration

#### From the API

1. Obtain your Secret Key from the [API Keys](https://platform.flatfile.com/dashboard/keys-and-secrets) page.
2. Make an authenticated request to the autobuild endpoint.

<CodeGroup>
```terminal file upload
curl -X POST https://api.x.flatfile.com/v1/apps/{appId}/autobuild?environmentId={environmentId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_123" \
  -F "file=@sample.csv"
```

```terminal field names
curl -X POST https://api.x.flatfile.com/v1/apps/{appId}/autobuild?environmentId={environmentId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_123" \
  -d '{"fields": "name, email, phone, address"}'
```

```terminal AI prompt
curl -X POST https://api.x.flatfile.com/v1/apps/{appId}/autobuild?environmentId={environmentId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_123" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Create a customer database with contact information and purchase history"}'
```

```terminal empty
curl -X POST https://api.x.flatfile.com/v1/apps/{appId}/autobuild?environmentId={environmentId}&empty=true \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_123"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Autobuild Process

When you initiate Autobuild, Flatfile performs the following steps:

1. **Analysis**: Examines your input (file, fields, or prompt) to understand the data structure
2. **Model Generation**: Creates a data model with appropriate fields, types, and validations
3. **Space Creation**: Sets up a working space with the generated model
4. **Agent Deployment**: Deploys a constraints agent to handle validation rules
5. **Transition to Build Mode**: Opens the working space in Build Mode for further refinement

<Note>
   The Autobuild process typically takes a few seconds to complete, depending on the complexity of your input.
</Note>

## Build Mode

Build Mode is a visual interface for configuring your Flatfile space. It allows you to modify workbooks, sheets, fields, and other aspects of your data model without writing code.

### Accessing Build Mode

You can access Build Mode in two ways:

1. **After Autobuild**: Build Mode opens automatically after Autobuild completes
2. **From an existing Space**: Click the "Enter Build Mode" toggle in the sidebar

2. Review your changes in the summary view
3. Click "Publish" to finalize your configuration

<Note>
   Publishing creates a snapshot of your configuration that can be used as a template for creating new spaces.
</Note>

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Start with a representative sample file** that includes all the fields and data types you need
2. **Use descriptive field names and labels** to make your configuration more intuitive
3. **Add field descriptions** to provide context for users
4. **Test your configuration** with sample data before publishing
5. **Use Build Mode Chat** for complex changes or when you're unsure how to implement something
6. **Create a consistent theme** that matches your brand identity
7. **Configure appropriate validations** to ensure data quality
8. **Organize related fields** into logical sheets and workbooks

<Tip>
   For complex configurations, consider breaking down your changes into smaller steps and testing each change incrementally.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
