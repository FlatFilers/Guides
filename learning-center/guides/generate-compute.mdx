Flatfile's AI-powered compute function generation enables you to automatically create JavaScript transformation functions based on natural language prompts. This feature helps you quickly implement complex data transformations without writing code manually.

## What are Compute Functions?

Compute functions are JavaScript functions that transform source data fields into destination fields. They can perform operations like:

- Combining multiple fields
- Extracting parts of strings
- Formatting dates
- Performing calculations
- Conditional transformations

## How Generate Compute Works

The generate compute feature uses AI to:

1. Analyze your source data schema
2. Understand sample data
3. Interpret your natural language prompt
4. Generate optimized JavaScript code that performs the requested transformation

## Using Generate Compute

When you need to transform data between fields, you can provide:

1. A schema definition of your source and destination fields
2. Sample data to demonstrate the transformation
3. A natural language prompt describing the transformation

The system will then generate a JavaScript function that performs the transformation.

### Example

Let's say you want to combine first name and last name fields into a full name field:

```javascript
// Schema definition
const schema = {
  sourceFields: [
    { key: "firstName", type: "string" },
    { key: "lastName", type: "string" }
  ],
  destinationFields: [
    { key: "fullName", type: "string" }
  ]
};

// Sample data
const samples = [
  { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" },
  { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Smith" }
];

// Natural language prompt
const prompt = "Combine first name and last name to create a full name with a space between them";

// Generate the compute function
const result = await generateCompute({ 
  schema, 
  samples, 
  prompt 
});
```

The system will generate a function like:

```javascript
function transform(source) {
  return {
    fullName: `${source.firstName} ${source.lastName}`
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

For optimal results with generate compute:

1. **Be specific in your prompts** - Clearly describe the transformation you want
2. **Provide diverse sample data** - Include edge cases and different data patterns
3. **Include all relevant fields** - Make sure your schema includes all fields needed for the transformation
4. **Review generated code** - Always check the generated code for correctness and edge cases

## Implementation Details

Behind the scenes, generate compute:

1. Formats your schema and sample data into a structured format
2. Sends this information along with your prompt to an AI model
3. Processes the response to extract the transformation function
4. Returns the function along with metadata about the transformation

The generated functions are designed to be efficient, handle edge cases, and follow JavaScript best practices.

## Error Handling

Generated compute functions include error handling for common issues like:

- Missing or null input values
- Type conversion errors
- Edge cases in data formatting

This ensures that your transformations are robust and can handle real-world data.

## Use Cases

Generate compute is particularly useful for:

- **Data normalization** - Standardizing formats across fields
- **Field combination** - Merging multiple fields into one
- **Data extraction** - Pulling specific information from complex fields
- **Format conversion** - Changing date formats, number formats, etc.
- **Conditional transformations** - Applying different logic based on field values

By leveraging AI to generate these functions, you can save development time and implement complex transformations with minimal effort.
