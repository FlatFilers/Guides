Saved Views allow users to create, manage, and share custom views of Sheet data, preserving filter configurations, sorting preferences, and search queries for future use.

## Overview

The Saved Views feature enables users to:

1. Save the current state of filters, sorting, and search queries as a named view
2. Switch between different views quickly
3. Share views with other users via shareable links
4. Organize and manage multiple views for the same dataset

This functionality is particularly useful for:
- Creating different perspectives on the same dataset
- Saving frequently used filter combinations
- Sharing specific data views with team members
- Maintaining consistent data analysis workflows

### Switching Between Views

To switch to a different saved view:

1. Click the "Saved views" dropdown in the toolbar
2. Select the desired view from the list

When a view is active, its name will be displayed in the toolbar with an option to clear it.

### Clearing a View

To clear the current view and return to the default state:

1. Click the view name in the toolbar
2. Confirm that you want to clear the view and all current filters

### Deleting a View

To delete a saved view:

1. Click the "Saved views" dropdown in the toolbar
2. Locate the view you want to delete
3. Click the trash icon next to the view name
4. Confirm the deletion

## Sharing Views

Saved Views can be shared with other users who have access to the same Space. When a view is activated, the URL is updated with the view's filter parameters, which can be copied and shared.

Recipients who open the shared URL will see the Sheet with the same filters, sorting, and search queries applied.

## Integration with Advanced Filters

Saved Views work seamlessly with [Advanced Filters](/learning-center/guides/advanced-filters), storing complex query configurations created through the Advanced Filters interface.

When Advanced Filters are enabled:
- Views can include complex query combinations
- The query toolbar state is preserved in the view
- Column-specific filters are stored as queries

## Technical Implementation

Saved Views are stored as resources in the Flatfile platform and are associated with specific Sheets. Each view contains:

- A name for identification
- The creator's information
- A configuration object with filter parameters
- Timestamps for creation and updates

### View Configuration

A view configuration can include:

- Filter parameters (q, filter, filterField)
- Search parameters (searchValue, searchField)
- Sorting parameters (sortField, sortDirection)
- Advanced query collections

### API Access

Views can be managed programmatically through the Flatfile API:

```javascript
// Create a new view
const newView = await api.views.create({
  name: "High Priority Items",
  sheetId: "us_sh_123",
  config: {
    q: "priority eq 'high'",
    sortField: "dueDate",
    sortDirection: "asc"
  }
});

// Get all views for a sheet
const views = await api.views.list({
  sheetId: "us_sh_123"
});

// Delete a view
await api.views.delete("us_vw_123");
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for views to make their purpose clear
- Create separate views for different analysis scenarios
- Regularly review and clean up unused views
- Use views to standardize reporting perspectives across teams

## Limitations

- Views are specific to individual Sheets and cannot span multiple Sheets
- View permissions follow the same access controls as the Sheet they belong to
- There may be a limit to the number of views that can be created per Sheet
