In the previous step, you performed a few actions:

- Created a Workbook with a simple schema
- A Space was also auto-generated

These actions create an <Tooltip tip="Anatomy of an Event...">[Event](../concepts/events)</Tooltip>. You can author code to listen and react to these Events by performing tasks such as validating and transforming records, importing and joining data from other sources, and even offloading data processing to your own API.

## About listeners

<Note>
  Flatfile provides a powerful Typescript/NodeJS SDK for working with Events and
  plugins. There are a lot of ways to listen to Events in other ways that we
  describe in the [Events](../concepts/events) docs.
</Note>

Using the Flatfile SDK, you can register any javascript function as an Event listener and start working with Events.

Here's an example of a very basic Event listener:

<CodeGroup>
```js javascript
export default function (listener) {
  listener.on("**", ({ topic }) => {
    console.log(`Received event: ${topic}`);
  });
}
```
```js typescript
import { FlatfileEvent, FlatfileListener } from "@flatfile/listener";

export default function flatfileEventListener(listener: FlatfileListener) {
  listener.on("**", ({ topic }: FlatfileEvent) => {
    console.log(`Received event: ${topic}`);
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This code exports a single function that accepts an instance of an object (named `listener` in the example). This object can be used to subscribe to different Events within your Flatfile <Tooltip tip="A micro-application...">[Space](../concepts/spaces)</Tooltip>. The example code subscribes to all Events (using the `**` selector) and writes the Event's topic name to the console.

Listeners are the basic building block of Flatfile logic. They span from simple validations and transformations to complex, multi-sheet workflows.

## Setup your first listener

Follow these steps:

1. [Fork this code in Github](https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started)
2. Rename `.env.examples` to `.env` and add your creds.
3. Run `npx flatfile@latest develop` from your terminal
4. Go to your Flatfile Workbook and make a few changes. For example, try typing text into a cell. (Note: The action button in top right will not yet work.)
5. Finally, return to your terminal to see how those Events were logged.

```ssh Console
> getting-started % npx flatfile develop
âœ” 1 environment(s) found for these credentials
âœ” Environment "development" selected
ncc: Version 0.36.1
ncc: Compiling file index.js into CJS

## Recap & Next Steps

Now that you've created a listener, we will [configure the Workbook Action](../quickstart/submit-action) to call out to an external webhook receiver provided by the [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) service.
