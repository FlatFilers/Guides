You've just created a Workbook.

In Flatfile, an event-based system, that means an [Event](../concepts/events) was published.

A [Listener](/concepts/listeners) is a function that is triggered by an Event. It's a powerful building block because it can be completely customized, enabling you to respond to events precisely the way your business and workflow requires.

In this step of the tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a listener to receive Events.

## About listeners

Let's take a look at a basic listener.

<CodeGroup>
```js javascript
export default function (listener) {
  listener.on("**", (event) => {
    console.log(`Received event: ${event.topic}`);
  });
}
```
```js typescript
import { FlatfileEvent, FlatfileListener } from "@flatfile/listener";

export default function flatfileEventListener(listener: FlatfileListener) {
  listener.on("**", (event: FlatfileEvent) => {
    console.log(`Received event: ${event.topic}`);
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

As you can see, this function is listening on "\*\*", which is a wildcard that matches all events. All this listener does, is log an incoming Event's topic.

## Setup your first listener

Let's walk through setting up your first listener. To do this, you'll be using some of the tools Flatfile provides for developers.

<Info>
  Flatfile is a Typescript/Javascript platform, so you will need to install
  Node.js to use all the tools Flatfile provides developers. Though not
  required, switch to Node.js v18 for the best experience.
</Info>

First, clone our [Getting Started](https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started) repository.

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started.git
```

Then, install dependencies.

<CodeGroup>
```ssh npm
npm install
```
```ssh yarn
yarn install
```

</CodeGroup>
Next, add your credentials.

Remember the secrets key you used to create your first Workbook? Your listener is going to use that same credential to receive Events.

To do this, create an `.env` file at the root of your cloned repository.

```ssh
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, update the `FLATFILE_API_KEY` value, setting it to your secrets key.

Each secrets key is scoped to an environment, so you will also need to update the `FLATFILE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` value to the one found on the same page as your secrets key.

## Run your first listener

Now that you have listener code configured with credentials, you're ready to listen for Events.

We'll run this listener locally by using the "develop" command from the Flatfile CLI.

You may chose to run either a Typescript or a Javascript version of this listener:

<CodeGroup>

```terminal ts listener
npx flatfile@latest develop typescript/index.ts
```

```terminal js listener
npx flatfile@latest develop javascript/index.js
```

</CodeGroup>

Congratulations, you have created your first listener!

You should see console output that looks like this:

```ssh console
> npx flatfile develop
✔ 1 environment(s) found for these credentials
✔ Environment "development" selected
ncc: Version 0.36.1
ncc: Compiling file index.js into CJS
  ✓ 427ms      GET    200 https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/subscription 12345

 File change detected. 🚀
  ✓ Connected to event stream for scope us_env_1234
```

## Watch your Events

To watch your listener receive an event, you'll need to trigger one.

Go to your Flatfile Workbook and make a few changes. For example, try typing text into a cell.

Typing in a cell (editing a Record) triggers an Event! And because your listener was running, it logged your activity.

```ssh console
 ▶ commit:created  10:13:05.159 AM us_evt_1234
 ↳ on(**, {})
 ↳ on(commit:created, {"sheetSlug":"contacts"})
```

## Next steps

Now that you've created a [Listener](/concepts/listeners), a powerful building block on the Flatfile platform, let's learn how to leverage your listener to [Transform and validate data](../quickstart/add-data-transformation).
