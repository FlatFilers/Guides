Flatfile provides a number of [transformation & validation plugins](../plugins/transform) to reshape data before it gets updated. These plugins build on the listener and provide a simpler interface for working with your data.

<Tip>
  Plugins are registered with the `listener.use()` function. This is explained
  further in [Events](../concepts/events) concepts.

## Add data to your workbook

Before we get started transforming data, let's upload a file with sample data.

<Card
  title="1. Download test file"
  icon="download"
  href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/6I48ynsesoL1s1YhPK8Pvx/1d5ed30534c1ef44166d440a08612621/getting-started.csv"
></Card>

2. Upload your [test file](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/6I48ynsesoL1s1YhPK8Pvx/1d5ed30534c1ef44166d440a08612621/getting-started.csv) in the Files section.

3. Click the "Import" Action for the file.

4. Follow the steps to map the example data into the "Contacts" Sheet in the Workbook.

## Adding your first data transformation

Now, let's dive into an example that showcases the power of the `@flatfile/plugin-record-hook` plugin. With this plugin, we can stay in the loop whenever a new row is added or an existing one is modified (via the [commit Event](../concepts/events#commit-created)), allowing us to take action and transform the data to our liking. Note: Existing rows will not receive updates unless modified.

In this particular scenario, we'll demonstrate how to grab the first name from the record and convert it
to lowercase.

<CodeGroup>
```js javascript
import { recordHook } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";

//previous code here

listener.use(
recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
const value = record.get("firstName");
if (typeof value === "string") {
record.set("firstName", value.toLowerCase());
}

      return record;
    })

);

````

```js typescript
import { recordHook, FlatfileRecord } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";

//previous code here

listener.use(
  recordHook("contacts", (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
    const value = record.get("firstName");
    if (typeof value === "string") {
      record.set("firstName", value.toLowerCase());
    }

    return record;
  })
);

````

</CodeGroup>

#### Using your transformation

Once the focus is off of the new First Name field, your transformation will run and convert the characters in your value to lowercase.

1. With the `develop` command still running in terminal, navigate to your Contacts Sheet and insert a new row where the First Name is written entirely in capital letters.
2. When the focus leaves the First Name field, your transformation will run and convert the characters in your value to lowercase.

## Adding your first validation

Similar to transforming data, we will continue to use the [record-hook plugin](../plugins/transform/record-hook) as the starting point for validating data.

In this particular scenario, we'll demonstrate how to add an error message if the email is invalid.

<Tip>You can use any npm package in a plugin.</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```js javascript
import { recordHook } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";

//previous code here

listener.use(
  recordHook("contacts", (record) => {
    //previous code here

    const email = record.get("email");
    const validEmailAddress = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;

    if (email !== null && !validEmailAddress.test(email)) {
      console.log("Invalid email address");
      record.addError("email", "Invalid email address");
    }

    return record;
  })
);
```

```js typescript
import { recordHook, FlatfileRecord } from "@flatfile/plugin-record-hook";

//previous code here

listener.use(
  recordHook("contacts", (record: FlatfileRecord) => {

    //previous code here

    const email = record.get("email") as string;
    const validEmailAddress = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;

    if (email !== null && !validEmailAddress.test(email)) {
      console.log("Invalid email address");
      record.addError("email", "Invalid email address");
    }

    return record;
  })
);
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Using your validation

Once you take focus off of the field, your validation will run and the Sheet user interface will display an error for the changed field.

1. With the `develop` command still running in terminal, go back to your Contacts Sheet.
2. Modify any value of Email Address to make it an invalid email address.
3. Take focus off the field you entered (click outside that field).

## Recap & Next Steps

Now that you've added transformations and validations, we will [configure the Workbook Action](../quickstart/submit-action) to call out to an external webhook receiver provided by the [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) service.
