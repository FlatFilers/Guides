title: 2. Transform & validate data
description: "Begin the process of validating and transforming data in Flatfile by implementing a basic event handler."
---

In the previous step, you performed a number of actions:

* Created a workbook with a simple schema
* Populated the workbook with a sample CSV file
* Edited the workbook using the Flatfile user interface

Each of these actions creates an [Event](../concepts/events). You can author code to listen and react to these events by performing tasks such as validating and transforming records, and even offloading data processing to your own API.

## Setting up a listener

<Note>Flatfile provides a powerful Typescript/NodeJS SDK for working with events and  plugins. There are a lot of ways to listen to events in other ways that we describe in the [Events](../concepts/events) docs.</Note>

Using the Flatfile SDK, you can register any javascript function as an event listener and start working with events. To keep it simple, we'll use a pre-configured Repl.it.

Follow these steps:

1. [Fork this repl.it](https://replit.com/@flatfile/get-started#index.ts)
2. Get your Secret Key from your [Developer Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers) and set it as the value for `process.env.FLATFILE_API_KEY`.
3. Click Run in your Repl.it
4. Go back to your Flatfile workbook and make a few changes, then see how those events were written in your Repl.it Console

Here's an example of a very basic event listener:

```js index.js
export default function(listener) {
  listener.on('**', (event) => {
    console.log('-> My event', event.topic)
  })
}
```

``` json Console
> npm run dev

> gettingstarted@1.0.0 dev
> node ./.config/dev.js

listening for events at 4/28/2023, 2:36:22 PM

sheet:validated us_evt_abc 4/28/2023, 2:36:36 PM
records:updated us_evt_abc 4/28/2023, 2:36:36 PM
sheet:validated us_evt_abc 4/28/2023, 2:36:36 PM
records:updated us_evt_abc 4/28/2023, 2:36:36 PM
```

This code exports a single function that accepts an instance of an object (named `listener` in the example). This object can be used to subscribe to different events within your Flatfile [Space](../concepts/spaces). The example code subscribes to all events (using the `**` selector) and writes the event's topic name to the console.

Listeners are the basic building block of Flatfile logic. They span from simple validations and transformations to complex, multi-sheet workflows.

## Working with Plugins

Flatfile provides a number of [transformation & validation plugins](https://flatfile.com/plugins) to reshape data before it gets updated. These plugins build on the listener and provide a simpler interface for working with your data. 

<Tip>Plugins are registered with the `listener.use()` function. This is explained further in [Events](../concepts/events) concepts.</Tip>

## Adding your first data transformation

In this example, we'll use the [@flatfile/plugin-record-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/plugin-record-hook) plugin to notify us of every row addition or modification and give us the ability to modify the data. For this example, we will take the first name record and make it lowercase.

```js index.js
import { recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-record-hook';

export default function(listener) {
  
  listener.use(
    recordHook('contacts', (record) => {
      const value = record.get('firstName')?.toString()
      if (value) {
        record.set('firstName', value.toLowerCase())
      }

      return record
    })
  )
}
```

#### Using your transformation 

Once the focus is off of the new First Name field, your transformation will run and convert the characters in your value to lowercase.

1. After starting the code in Repl.it, navigate to your Contacts sheet and insert a new row where the First Name is written entirely in capital letters. 
2. When the focus leaves the First Name field, your transformation will run and convert the characters in your value to lowercase.


## Adding your first validation

Similar to transforming data, we can use the [record-hook plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/plugin-record-hook) as the starting point for validating data.

<Tip>
You can use any npm package in a plugin.
</Tip>

```js index.js
import { recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-record-hook';

const validEmailAddress = /^[\w\d.-]+@[\w\d]+\.\w+$/;

export default function(listener) {
  listener.use(recordHook('contacts', (record) => {

    let emailAddress = record.get('email');
    if (!validEmailAddress.test(emailAddress)) {
      record.addError('email', 'Invalid email address');
    }

    return record
  }))
}
```

#### Using your validation 

Once you take focus off of the field, your validation will run and the sheet user interface will display an error for the changed field.

1. After starting the code in Repl.it, go back to your Contacts sheet.
2. Modify any value of Email Address to make it an invalid email address. 
3. Take focus off the field you entered (click outside that field).

## Recap & Next Steps

You now have a locally-running listener that is responding to record changes in your Workbook, and can perform simple data transformations and validations.

Next, we will [add an action](submit-action) that will call out to an external webhook receiver provided by the [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) service.
