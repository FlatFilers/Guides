For a production deployment, listeners can be hosted either in your cloud or directly on the Flatfile platform. Learn more about <Tooltip tip="More deployment methods">[deploying](../developer-tools/deploying)</Tooltip>.

## Deploying the listener example to Flatfile

Using the `flatfile` command line tool, we will now deploy your listener code into the Flatfile platform.

1. Clone the Getting Started repo
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started.git
```

  <Card title="getting-started" href="https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started" icon="github">
  This code repository has everything you did in the quickstart example.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

2. Run the deploy command from the root directory

<Note> If you are working on Flatfile integration in a brand-new IDE instance, ensure you execute `npm install` before you run the command below.</Note>

```terminal
npx flatfile@latest deploy --token=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```
