title: 4. Deploy to Flatfile
description: Publish your new configuration to Flatfile and move beyond this simple sandbox.

For a production deployment, listeners can be hosted either in your cloud or directly on the Flatfile platform. 

#### Hosting in your own cloud

Hosting listener code in your own cloud works similarly to how we have been running code using repl.it. 

1. The listener process is launched
2. It polls the Flatfile API for updates
3. It then responds to those events accordingly

#### Hosting on the Flatfile platform

While your own cloud provides the maximum level of control over listener code, qualities such as availability and network performance are the responsibility of the hosting provider. In order to gain more consistent, low latency and high ability, listeners may be securely deployed and run in the Flatfile platform cloud. 

## Deploying to Flatfile

In order to deploy listener listener code into the Flatfile platform, we can use the `flatfile` command line tool. [Clone a sample project](https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started) and run deploy from your local directory.

```terminal
npx flatfile deploy
```

And with that, you can now create a workbook, add data and workflow logic, and deploy it to the Flatfile platform!
