For a production deployment, listeners can be hosted either in your cloud or directly on the Flatfile platform. Learn more about [deploying](../developer-tools/deploying).

## Deploying a listener

Using the `flatfile` command line tool, we will now deploy your listener code into the Flatfile platform.

```terminal
npx flatfile@latest deploy typescript/index.ts
```

## Recap & what's next

You can now create a Workbook (though, we suggest [building it dynamically](/guides/dynamic-configurations) next time), add data and workflow logic, and deploy it to the Flatfile platform!

Where you go next depends on the what you're trying to accomplish. A few possibilities include the following:
