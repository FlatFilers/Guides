For a production deployment, listeners can be hosted either in your cloud or directly on the Flatfile platform. Learn more about [deploying](../developer-tools/deploying).

## Deploying the listener example to Flatfile

Using the `flatfile` command line tool, we will now deploy your listener code into the Flatfile platform.

1. Clone the Getting Started repo

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started.git
```

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="getting-started"
    href="https://github.com/FlatFilers/getting-started"
    icon="github"
  >
    This code repository has everything you did in the quickstart example.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

2. Update your .env file and run the deploy command from the root directory

<Note>
  {" "}
  If you are working on Flatfile integration in a brand-new IDE instance, ensure
  you execute `npm install` before you run the command below.
</Note>

```terminal
npx flatfile@latest deploy typescript/index.ts
```

## Recap & what's next

You can now create a Workbook (though, we suggest [building it dynamically](/guides/dynamic-configurations) next time), add data and workflow logic, and deploy it to the Flatfile platform!

Where you go next depends on the what you're trying to accomplish. A few possibilities include the following:
