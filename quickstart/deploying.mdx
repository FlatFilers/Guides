title: 4. Deploy to Flatfile
description: Publish your new configuration to Flatfile and move beyond this simple sandbox.
---

Use this command to deploy this so that it's not running in your local browser:

```
npx flatfile deploy
```

***That simple!*** 

Now any time you create a workbook, it'll benefit from all the same hooks and configuration.
Follow a core path to build to your use case or clone a sample project.

## Recap & Next Steps 

You've deployed the basics but there's so much more you can do with Flatfile.
