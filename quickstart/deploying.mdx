title: 4. Deploying
description: Publish your new configuration to Flatfile and move beyond this simple sandbox.
---

# Let's deploy this so that it's not running in your local browser

```
npx flatfile deploy
```

That simple! Now any time you create a workbook, it'll benefit from all the same hooks and configuration. There's so
much more you can do with Flatfile. You've deployed the basics. But some of the things you'll want to do next might be:

[todo]
1. Learn about spaces
2. Allow your team to create dynamically generated spaces & workbooks from the dashboard
3. Designing more complex data workflows with jobs
4. Automating your development & deployment process
5. Build more complex egress processes
6. Creating extractors
7. Embedding this workbook in your React, Vue, Angular or HTML application
