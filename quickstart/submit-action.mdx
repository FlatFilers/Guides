title: 3. Configure a submit action
description: "Learn how to create a simple submit Action in Flatfile."

Actions refer to buttons added to the user interface that trigger <Tooltip tip="Learn about Jobs">[Jobs](../concepts/jobs)</Tooltip> within the Flatfile platform when clicked by users. They enable you to run complex operations and streamline workflows. They are declared as part of the Blueprint that defines a Workbook.

## Adding your first Action

In this example, we're going to add behavior to our Workbook's primary Action (`submitAction`). When the button is clicked by a user, our code will call out to an external webhook receiver provided by the [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) service.

1. To create the receiver, navigate to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site)
2. Copy the value of `Your unique URL`.
3. Next, add the following to your default export function in Repl.it.

```js index.js
export default function(listener) {
  // existing code

  listener.on('action:triggered', async (event) => {
      const webhookReceiver = '<WEBHOOK URL>';  
      
      const res = await fetch(webhookReceiver, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(event.payload)
      })
  })
}
```

#### Testing your Action

1. Once you've updated your code, run it in Repl.it.
2. In your Workbook, click the submit Action in the top right corner.
3. In webhook.site, look at the query log and observe that the webhook received a call; this is the Action running.

## Recap & Next Steps
Congratulations! You now have a Workbook with transformations, validations, and a submit Action.

To this point, we've been hosting our listener code using Repl.it. While this enabled us to get up and running with Flatfile quickly, it is not representative of a full deployment. Next, you should [deploy your code](../developer-tools/deploying).
