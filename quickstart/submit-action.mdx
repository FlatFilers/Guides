Actions refer to buttons added to the user interface that trigger <Tooltip tip="Large asynchronous work...">[Jobs](../concepts/jobs)</Tooltip> within the Flatfile platform when clicked by users. They enable you to run complex operations and streamline workflows. They are declared as part of the Blueprint that defines a Workbook.

## Adding your first Action

In this example, we're going to add behavior to our Workbook's primary Action (`submitAction`). When the button is clicked by a user, our code will call out to an external webhook receiver provided by the [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) service.

1. To create the receiver, navigate to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) 2. Copy the value of the path after webhook.site for `Your unique URL`.
3. Next, add the following to your default export function.

```js index.js
export default function(listener) {
  // existing code

  const https = require('https');

  listener.on('action:triggered', async (event) => {

    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const req = https.request({
        method: 'POST',
        protocol: 'https:',
        hostname: 'webhook.site',
        // copy your https://webhook.site path for testing
        path: '/<COPY_PATH_HERE>',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
      });
      const body = JSON.stringify({ event }, null, 2);
      req.write(body);
      req.on('response', (res) => { resolve(); });
      req.on('error', (err) => { reject(err); });
      req.end();
    });

  })
}
```

#### Testing your Action

1. With the `develop` command still running in terminal, head to your Workbook and click the submit Action in the top right corner.
2. In webhook.site, look at the query log and observe that the webhook received a call; this is the Action running.

## Recap & Next Steps
Congratulations! You now have a Workbook with transformations, validations, and a submit Action.

To this point, we've been running our listener code locally using the `develop` command. Next, you should [deploy your code](../developer-tools/deploying).
