title: 3. Configure a submit action
description: "Learn how to create a simple submit action in Flatfile."

Actions refer to buttons added to the user interface that trigger <Tooltip tip="Learn about Jobs">[Jobs](../concepts/jobs)</Tooltip> within the Flatfile ecosystem [when clicked by end users]. They are highly powerful tools that can automate various tasks and streamline workflow processes.

## Adding your first action

In this example, we're going to add an action to the primary action `submitAction` you see in the workbook you have already deployed.
This action will take the data from the sheet and submit it to webhook.site.

<a target="_blank" class="group px-4 py-1.5 relative inline-flex items-center rounded-full shadow-sm text-sm font-medium"
href="https://replit.com/@flatfile/get-started#index.ts">
    <span class="absolute inset-0 bg-primary-dark rounded-full group-hover:opacity-[0.9]"></span>
    <span class="z-10 mr-2 text-white">See it in Replit</span>
    <svg width="6" height="3" class="h-2 overflow-visible -rotate-90 text-white" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 0L3 3L6 0" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round"></path></svg>
</a>


```js
import { recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-record-hook'
import * as EmailValidator from 'email-validator';
import got from 'got';

export default function(listener) {
  // ... your previous recordHook logic

  listener.on('action:triggered', async (event) => {
    // go to https://webhook.site and copy your own URL in here to test with:
    const res = await got.post('https://webhook.site/34ecb8ef-fd75-49e1-8efe-9ff0b6a937be', {
      json: event.payload
    })
  })
}
```

### Testing your action

- Once you've updated your listener code. Click the "Run" button in the top of the Replit window.
- Go to your Workbook and click the submit action.
- View the log showing the handled event and view the data payload sent to your webhook.site URL.

### Using Action Plugins

## Recap & Next Steps
Congratulations! You now have a configured workbook with transformations, validations, and a final submit action.
This completes the Quickstart tutorial.

Next, you should [deploy your code](../developer-tools/deploying) to your Environment or
learn more about the [Concepts](../concepts/spaces) to take this example further.
