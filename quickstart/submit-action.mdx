title: 3. Configure a submit action
description: "Learn how to create a simple submit action in Flatfile."

Actions refer to buttons added to the user interface that trigger <Tooltip tip="Learn about Jobs">[Jobs](../concepts/jobs)</Tooltip> within the Flatfile platform when clicked by users. They enable you to automate tasks and streamline workflows. They are declared as a part of the workbook definition.

## Adding your first action

In this example, we're going to add behavior to our workbook's primary action (`submitAction`). When the button is clicked by a user, our code will call out to an external webook reciever provided by the [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) service.

To create the receiver, navigate to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) and copy the value of `Your unique URL`.

Next, add the following to your default export function in repl.it.

```js

export default function(listener) {
  // existing code

  listener.on('action:triggered', async (event) => {
      const webhookReceiver = '<Webhook URL>';  
      // copy your https://webhook.site URL for testing
      const res = await fetch(webhookReceiver, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(event.payload)
      })
  })
}
```

### Testing your action

- Once you've updated your listener, run it in repl.it.
- In your Workbook, click the submit action.
- In webhook.site, look at the query log and observe that the webhook received a call from the listener code.

## Recap & Next Steps
Congratulations! You now have a workbook with transformations, validations, and a submit action.

To this point, we've been hosting our listener code using repl.it. While this enabled us to get up and running with Flatfile quickly, it is not representative of a production deployment. Next, you should [deploy your code](../developer-tools/deploying) to your own environment.
