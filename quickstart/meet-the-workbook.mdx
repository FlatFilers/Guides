A <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](https://flatfileinc.mintlify.dev/docs/concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip> replaces the spreadsheet template(s) that you may currently share with others when requesting data. Unlike a spreadsheet, a Workbook enables your users to import, validate, and correct data before sending it back to you.

<Info>
  Prerequisites: You'll need a Flatfile account and your [secret

## Building your first Workbook

#### Create a Workbook

We'll begin by creating a new Workbook using Flatfile's API. Paste this cURL request in your terminal to create a simple Workbook or <Tooltip tip="Create a sample Workbook">[run this command directly from our docs](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/tjt005wdogklo-create-a-sample-workbook)</Tooltip>.

<Tip>
  Use your [secret
  key](../developer-tools/security/authentication#secret-and-publishable-keys)
  from the `development` environment. Secret key format is "sk_abcd..." and is
  found in [your Flatfile Dashboard
  here](https://platform.flatfile.com/developers).
</Tip>

```shell Shell / cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/workbooks \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer PASTE_SECRET_KEY_HERE' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "My First Workbook",
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contact",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "firstName",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "First Name"
        },
        {
          "key": "lastName",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Last Name"
        },
        {
          "key": "email",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Email"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "operation": "submitAction",
      "mode": "foreground",
      "label": "Submit",
      "description": "Submit data to webhook.site",
      "primary": true
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Using schemas

Flatfile’s <Tooltip tip="A Data Definition Language...">[Blueprint](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip> is a robust data definition language (DDL) that emphasizes validation and data preparation. Flatfile's API expects the Blueprint format creating or updating a schema definition.

### Add data to your Workbook

Now that you have a Workbook, you're now ready to start importing data with Flatfile!

1. Head to your <Tooltip tip="Go to dashboard">[Spaces Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com)</Tooltip> and click on
   the Workbook you just created (My First Workbook). You may need to refresh the page.
2. Upload a [test file](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/6I48ynsesoL1s1YhPK8Pvx/1d5ed30534c1ef44166d440a08612621/getting-started.csv) in the Files section, and then click the "Import" Action for the file. Follow the steps to map the example data into the "Contact" Sheet in the Workbook.
3. After mapping is complete, you can click on the "Contact" icon in the left sidebar and see the imported data.
4. Additionally, you can make changes to the Workbook in the Contact Sheet's user interface by modifying existing records or adding new rows entirely.
