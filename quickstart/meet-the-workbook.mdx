## About the Workbook

A <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](https://flatfileinc.mintlify.dev/docs/concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip> replaces the spreadsheet template(s) that you may currently share with others when requesting data. Unlike a spreadsheet, a Workbook enables your users to import, validate, and correct data before sending it back to you.

### Using schemas in Workbooks

Flatfileâ€™s <Tooltip tip="A Data Definition Language...">[Blueprint](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip> is a robust data definition language (DDL) that emphasizes validation and data preparation. Flatfile's API expects the Blueprint format creating or updating a schema definition.
