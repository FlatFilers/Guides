### Using schemas

Flatfileâ€™s <Tooltip tip="A Data Definition Language...">[Blueprint](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip> is a robust data definition language (DDL) that emphasizes validation and data preparation. Flatfile's API expects the Blueprint format creating or updating a schema definition.

### Add data to your Workbook

Now that you have a Workbook, you're now ready to start importing data with Flatfile!

1. Head to your <Tooltip tip="Go to dashboard">[Spaces Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com)</Tooltip> and click on
   the Workbook you just created (My First Workbook). You may need to refresh the page.
2. Upload a [test file](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/6I48ynsesoL1s1YhPK8Pvx/1d5ed30534c1ef44166d440a08612621/getting-started.csv) in the Files section, and then click the "Import" Action for the file. Follow the steps to map the example data into the "Contact" Sheet in the Workbook.
3. After mapping is complete, you can click on the "Contact" icon in the left sidebar and see the imported data.
4. Additionally, you can make changes to the Workbook in the Contact Sheet's user interface by modifying existing records or adding new rows entirely.
