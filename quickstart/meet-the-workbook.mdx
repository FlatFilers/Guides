A <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Workbooks">[Workbook](../concepts/workbook)</Tooltip> in Flatfile replaces the spreadsheet template you may share 
with people today when requesting data during the data collection phase 
of customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, 
it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.

In the next 15 minutes, you’ll design and configure a workbook 
for your business. Once you’re finished you’ll be able to embed it in your application 
as an import flow.

### Using Schemas

To post to our API, your schema will need to match Flatfile's <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Blueprint](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip>, a powerful DDL with a focus on validation and data preparation.  

For this tutorial, we’re going to use a simple schema that’s already using Flatfile’s Blueprint; 
however, if you have an existing schema, you can choose from many different open-source [blueprint converter plugins](https://plugins.flatfile.com) like:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-json-schema" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-openapi" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-graphql" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Create a workbook 

1. Paste this cURL request to your terminal now to create a simple workbook or [run this command directly from our docs](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10/branches/ashley-mulligan-sample-workbook/tjt005wdogklo-create-a-sample-workbook).
2. Login and see the workbook you created in your [Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com).

```shell Shell / cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/workbooks \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <secretKey>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "My First Workbook",
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contacts",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "firstName",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "First Name"
        },
        {
          "key": "lastName",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Last Name"
        },
        {
          "key": "email",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Email"
        }
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "slug": "submitAction",
          "label": "Submit",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Submit data to webhook.site",
          "primary": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

## Recap & Next Steps

You're now ready to start importing data with Flatfile! 

Head to your [Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com) to see 
the workbook and go through a test import. After you finish importing, 
you should see the data appear in the Workbook sheet. 

In the next step, we will take things a 
step further and learn how to respond to record events with transformations and validations.
