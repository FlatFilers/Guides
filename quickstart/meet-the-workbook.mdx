A <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Workbooks">[Workbook](../concepts/workbook)</Tooltip> in Flatfile replaces the spreadsheet template you may share 
with people today when requesting data during the data collection phase 
of customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, 
it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.

In the next 15 minutes, you’ll design and configure a workbook 
for your business. Once you’re finished you’ll be able to embed it in your application 
as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.

### Using Schemas

To post to our API, your schema will need to match Flatfile's <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Blueprint](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip>, a powerful DDL with a focus on validation and data preparation.  

For this tutorial, we’re going to use a simple schema that’s already using Flatfile’s Blueprint; 
however, if you have an existing schema, you can choose from many different open-source [blueprint converter plugins](https://plugins.flatfile.com) like:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-json-schema" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-openapi" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-graphql" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Create a workbook 

1. Paste this cURL request to your terminal now to create a simple workbook or [run this command directly from our docs](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10/branches/ashley-mulligan-sample-workbook/tjt005wdogklo-create-a-sample-workbook).
2. Login and see the workbook you created in your [Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com).

      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "firstName",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "First Name"

          "type": "string",
          "description": "Submit data to webhook.site",
          "primary": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}'
```

## Recap & Next Steps

Now that you have a workbook in your Dashboard and know how to use schemas in Flatfile, you can actually stop here if this solves your use case.

In the next step, we will take things a step further and learn how to respond to record events with transformations and validations.
