In Flatfile, a <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Workbooks">[Workbook](../concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip> serves as a replacement for the spreadsheet template(s) that you may currently share with others to request data for data collection during customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, a workbook is specifically designed to enable your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.

Within the next 15 minutes, you can create and set up a workbook for your business. After completing the process, you will have the ability to embed it in your application as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.

### Using Schemas

Flatfile’s <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Blueprint](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip> is a robust data definition language (DDL) that emphasizes validation and data preparation. To successfully create a Workbook via API, you must define a valid CSV in the Blueprint DDL.

For this tutorial, we’re going to use a simple schema that’s already using Flatfile’s Blueprint; 
however, if you have an existing schema, you can choose from many different open-source [blueprint converter plugins](https://flatfile.com/plugins) like:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-json-schema" icon="npm" href="https://flatfie.com/plugins">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl" icon="npm" href="https://flatfie.com/plugins">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-openapi" icon="npm" href="https://flatfie.com/plugins">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-graphql" icon="npm" href="https://flatfie.com/plugins">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Building your first Workbook

#### Create a workbook 

Paste this cURL request to your terminal now to create a simple workbook or [run this command directly from our docs](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10/tjt005wdogklo-create-a-sample-workbook).

```shell Shell / cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/workbooks \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer PASTE_SECRET_KEY_HERE' \

## Recap & Next Steps

You're now ready to start importing data with Flatfile! 

Head to your [Spaces Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com) and click on 
the workbook you just created (My First Workbook). Upload a [test file](https://FlatFilers.github.io/Guides/quickstart/getting-started.csv), click the "Import" action for the file, and then follow the steps to complete importing the data into the "Contacts" worksheet. After the import workflow is complete, you can click on the "Contacts" icon in the left sidebar and see the imported data. Additionally, you can embellish the imported data in the user interface by modifying  existing records or adding new rows entirely.

In the next step, we will delve deeper into responding to record events with transformations and validations.
