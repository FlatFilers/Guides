In Flatfile, a <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Workbooks">[Workbook](../concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip> serves as a replacement for the spreadsheet template(s) that you may currently share with others to request data for data collection during customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, a Workbook is specifically designed to enable your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.

Prerequisites: You'll need a Flatfile account and your [secret key](../developer-tools/security/authentication#secret-and-publishable-keys) to complete this tutorial. [Sign up](https://platform.flatfile.com/account/sign-up) and use the secret key from your `development` environment for this tutorial.

### Using Schemas

Flatfile’s <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Blueprint](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip> is a robust data definition language (DDL) that emphasizes validation and data preparation. Flatfile's API expects the Blueprint format whenever you are interacting with a schema definition.

For this tutorial, we’re going to use a simple schema that’s already using Flatfile’s Blueprint; 
however, if you have an existing schema, you can choose from many different open-source [blueprint converter plugins](https://flatfile.com/plugins) like:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-json-schema" icon="npm" href="https://flatfile.com/plugins/json-schema">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl" icon="npm" href="https://flatfile.com/plugins/sql-ddl">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-openapi" icon="npm" href="https://flatfile.com/plugins/openapi">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-graphql" icon="npm" href="https://flatfile.com/plugins/graphql">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Building your first Workbook

#### Create a workbook 

Paste this cURL request to your terminal now to create a simple workbook or [run this command directly from our docs](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10/tjt005wdogklo-create-a-sample-workbook).

<Tip>
Use your [secret key](../developer-tools/security/authentication#secret-and-publishable-keys) from the `development` environment.
</Tip>

```shell Shell / cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1/workbooks \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer PASTE_SECRET_KEY_HERE' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "My First Workbook",
  "sheets": [
    {
      "name": "Contacts",
      "slug": "contacts",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "firstName",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "First Name"
        },
        {
          "key": "lastName",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Last Name"
        },
        {
          "key": "email",
          "type": "string",
          "label": "Email"
        }
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "slug": "submitAction",
          "label": "Submit",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Submit data to webhook.site",
          "primary": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}' | json_pp
```

### Add data to your workbook

Now that you have a Workbook, you're now ready to start importing data with Flatfile! 

1. Head to your [Spaces Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com) and click on 
the Workbook you just created (My First Workbook). You may need to refresh the page.
2. Upload a [test file](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hjneo4qi4goj/6I48ynsesoL1s1YhPK8Pvx/1d5ed30534c1ef44166d440a08612621/getting-started.csv) in the Files section, and then click the "Import" action for the file. Follow the steps to map the example data into the "Contact" Sheet. 
3. After mapping is complete, you can click on the "Contact" icon in the left sidebar and see the imported data. 
4. Additionally, you can make changes to the Workbook in the user interface by modifying existing records or adding new rows entirely.
