If you don't already have one, sign up for a Flatfile account [here](https://platform.flatfile.com/account/sign-up).

<Note>
  To go through this tutorial you'll need a Flatfile account. We'll be using the
  credentials from your free account to assemble your first data import
  experience.
</Note>

In your account use the quickcopy button to copy your secrets key. You're about to use this credential to create a Workbook in your account.

## Create a Workbook

The adjacent curl command creates a Workbook.

Copy this command, replace "PASTE_SECRET_KEY_HERE" with the credential you just fetched from your account, and run it in your terminal.

Congratulations! You've just created your first Workbook.

<Info>
  If you are uncertain how to use cURL, you can run the same command from our
  site
  [here](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/api/tjt005wdogklo-create-a-sample-workbook).

## Meet your Workbook

So what did that just do?

In your Flatfile account you should now be able to see your Workbook.

<img
  src="../images/quickstart/first_workbook.png"
  caption="your first workbook"
/>

As you can see, this Workbook has a sheet and fields. A <Tooltip tip="Analogous to a database...">[Workbook](https://flatfileinc.mintlify.dev/docs/concepts/workbooks)</Tooltip> is like a template, it's definition includes a profile of the data it expects to hold. We call that profile a Blueprint.

<Note>
  [Blueprint](../blueprint/overview) is Flatfile's robust data definition
  language (DDL) that emphasizes validation and data preparation. Flatfile APIs
  leverage Blueprint for their create, update, and read operations.

## Next steps

Now that you have a Workbook, which acts both as a schema and destination for your data, you're ready to [Setup a listener](../quickstart/meet-the-listener).
