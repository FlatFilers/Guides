In Flatfile, a <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Workbooks">[Workbook](../concepts/workbook)</Tooltip> serves as a replacement for the spreadsheet template(s) that you may currently share with others to request data for data collection during customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, a workbook is specifically designed to enable your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.

Within the next 15 minutes, you can create and set up a workbook for your business. After completing the process, you will have the ability to embed it in your application as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.

### Using Schemas

To successfully post to our API, your schema must align with Flatfile's <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Blueprint](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip>, which is a robust data definition language (DDL) that emphasizes validation and data preparation.

For this tutorial, we’re going to use a simple schema that’s already using Flatfile’s Blueprint; 
however, if you have an existing schema, you can choose from many different open-source [blueprint converter plugins](https://plugins.flatfile.com) like:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-json-schema" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-openapi" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-graphql" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfie.com">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Recap & Next Steps

You're now ready to start importing data with Flatfile! 

Head to your [Dashboard](https://platform.flatfile.com) to see 
the workbook and go through a test import. After you finish importing, 
you should see the data appear in the Workbook sheet. 

In the next step, we will delve deeper into responding to record events with transformations and validations.
