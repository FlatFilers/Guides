### Check for proper `guestAuthentication`

<Info>
  You can skip this if you've not manually created a new Environment in your
  Account.
</Info>

The Space you'll create must have `guestAuthentication` configured with `shared_link` as an
option. This is inherited from the Environment you're working in.

This comes standard on any out of the box Environments so you shouldn't have to do anything unless you made a new Environment. If so, update your Environment to include if `shared_link` isn't there.
