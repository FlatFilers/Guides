### Check for proper `guestAuthentication`

<Note>
  You can skip this step if you haven't created a custom Environment in your
  Account.
</Note>

The Space you'll create must have `guestAuthentication` configured with `shared_link` as an
option. This is inherited from the Environment you're working in and can be found in your Developer Settings area.

This comes standard on all out-of-the-box Environments (`develop` / `production`) so you shouldn't have to do anything unless you have created a custom Environment.
