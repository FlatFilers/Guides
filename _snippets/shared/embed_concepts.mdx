## Concepts

When you embed Flatfile, you are using an iframe to embed a [Space](../../concepts/spaces) directly into your application. A Space consists of:

- A [Workbook](../../concepts/workbooks), which defines the structure of the data you are working with. It is analogous to a database.
- [Events](../../concepts/events), which allow you to listen for and respond to things that occur inside your Space. Examples include uploading a file or submitting data.
