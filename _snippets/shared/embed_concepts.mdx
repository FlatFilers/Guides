## Concepts

Using an iframe, Flatfile seamlessly integrates into your website or application, providing a simple yet robust experience for collecting and transforming data from your customers.

Front-end SDK wrappers around the [Flatfile API](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/) allow you to securely and easily add an embedded data import experience, also known as a [Space](/concepts/spaces), directly into to your application.

A Space consists of:

- A [Workbook](../../concepts/workbooks), which includes Sheets & Fields, and defines your schema.
- [Events](../../concepts/events), which allow you to listen for and respond to things that occur inside your Space, like performing transformations or validations when data is added or updated.
- [Actions](../../concepts/actions), which will allow you to define the destination of your Submit Data action.
