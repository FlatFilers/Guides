## Concepts

Front-end SDK wrappers around the [Flatfile API](https://reference.flatfile.com/docs/api/) allow you to securely and easily add an embedded data import experience, also known as a [Space](/concepts/spaces), directly into to your application.

A Space consists of:

- A [Workbook](../../concepts/workbooks), which defines the structure of the data you are working with. It is analogous to a database.
- [Events](../../concepts/events), which allow you to listen for and respond to things that occur inside your Space. Examples include uploading a file or submitting data.
