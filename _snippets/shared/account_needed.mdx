### Get your keys

To complete this tutorial, you'll need to retrieve your [Publishable
  key](../../developer-tools/security/authentication#secret-and-publishable-keys) from your `development` environment.

 <Info>
  Note: The publishable key is safe to be used in client-side applications as it has limited access to the Flatfile API.
